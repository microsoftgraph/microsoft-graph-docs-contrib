## Acrolinx Scorecards

**The minimum Acrolinx topic score of 80 is required for all Microsoft Graph content merged to the default branch.**

If you need a scoring exception for content in this PR, add the *ready for content review* and the *acrolinx exception* labels to the PR. The content review team will review the exception request and may take one or more of the following actions:

- Work with you to resolve the issues requiring the exception.
- Escalate the exception request to the Acrolinx Review Team for review.
- Approve the exception and work with the GitHub Admin Team to merge the PR to the default branch.

For more information about the exception criteria and exception process, see [Acrolinx for Microsoft Graph docs](https://eng.ms/cid/27dee76c-3a60-4e65-8fdf-08ea849b3498/fid/d80517923e291f07a0da8b5ce8e082ba680a55ddda65497a1061ca9f97c50290).

Select the scorecard links for each article to review the Acrolinx feedback on grammar, spelling, punctuation, writing style, and terminology:
