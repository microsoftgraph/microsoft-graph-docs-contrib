            Thanks for your pull request, ${issueAuthor}! I've added the **do not merge** label as a default status.


            Please add the **ready for content review** label to start a review. Your PR won't be reviewed until you add this label.


            After the content review is complete and the updates in this PR are ready for external customers to use, please replace the **do not merge** label with **ready to merge**.


            > [!NOTE]

            > Pull requests will not be merged until the **ready to merge** label is set.
