- **do not merge** is the default PR status and is automatically added to all open PRs that don't have the **ready to merge** label.
- Add the **ready for content review** label to start a review. Only PRs that have met the [minimum requirements for content review](https://eng.ms/cid/27dee76c-3a60-4e65-8fdf-08ea849b3498/fid/679c4bf497d767aa4c1e409cd143d7109564b93a118c29e0e11b15eb04b78844) and have this label are reviewed.
- If your content reviewer requests changes, review the feedback and address accordingly as soon as possible to keep your pull request moving forward. After you address the feedback, remove the **changes requested** label, add the **review feedback addressed** label, and select the **Re-request review** icon next to the content reviewer's alias. If you can't add labels, add a comment with `#feedback-addressed` to the pull request.
- After the content review is complete, your reviewer will add the **content review complete** label. When the updates in this PR are ready for external customers to use, replace the **do not merge** label with **ready to merge** and the PR will be merged within 24 working hours.
- Pull requests that are inactive for more than 6 weeks will be automatically closed. Before that, you receive reminders at 2 weeks, 4 weeks, and 6 weeks. If you still need the PR, you can reopen or recreate the request.
