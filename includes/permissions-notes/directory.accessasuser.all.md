> [!CAUTION]
> Directory permissions grant broad access to directory (Microsoft Entra ID) resources such as [user](/graph/api/resources/user), [group](/graph/api/resources/group), and [device](/graph/api/resources/device) in an organization. Whenever possible, choose permissions specific to these resources and avoid using directory permissions.

> Directory permissions might be deprecated in the future.
