Administrators can configure [application access policy](/graph/auth-limit-mailbox-access) to limit app access to *specific* mailboxes and not to all the mailboxes in the organization, even if the app has been granted the *MailboxSettings.ReadWrite* application permission.

*MailboxSettings.ReadWrite* is valid valid for both Microsoft accounts and work or school accounts.
