### Identity and access reports best practices

Microsoft Entra reporting APIs are throttled when Microsoft Entra ID receives too many calls during a given timeframe from a tenant or app. Calls might also be throttled if the service takes too long to respond. If your requests still fail with a `429 Too Many Requests` error code despite applying the [best practices to handle throttling](/graph/throttling#best-practices-to-handle-throttling), try reducing the amount of data returned. Try these approaches first:
- Use filters to target your query to just the data you need. If you only need a certain type of event or a subset of users, for example, filter out other events using the `$filter` and `$select` query parameters to reduce the size of your response object and the risk of throttling.
- If you need a broad set of Microsoft Entra ID reporting data, use `$filter` on the **createdDateTime** to limit the number of sign-in events you query in a single call. Then, iterate through the next timespan until you have all the records you need. For example, if you're being throttled, you can begin with a call that requests three days of data and iterate with shorter timespans until your requests are no longer throttled.
- The `$select=signInActivity` parameter on the [List users](/graph/api/user-list) operation may cause stricter throttling than standard Microsoft Graph API calls. To avoid these limits, only use this parameter when necessary. If you need sign-in activity data, use `$top=500` to get the maximum 500 users per page instead of the default 100. This reduces the total number of API calls required.
