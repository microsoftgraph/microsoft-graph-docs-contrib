All Azure MCP tools in a single server. The Azure MCP Server implements the [MCP specification](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) to create a seamless connection between AI agents and Azure services. Azure MCP Server can be used alone or with the [GitHub Copilot for Azure extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-azure-github-copilot) in VS Code.

# Overview

**Azure MCP Server** supercharges your agents with Azure context across **40+ different Azure services**.

# Installation
- To use Azure MCP server from node one must have Node.js (LTS) installed and available on your system PATH — this provides both `npm` and `npx`. We recommend Node.js 20 LTS or later. To verify your installation run: `node --version`, `npm --version`, and `npx --version`.
-  Configure the `mcp.json` file with the following:

    ```json
    {
        "mcpServers": {
            "azure-mcp-server": {
            "command": "npx",
            "args": [
                "-y",
                "@azure/mcp@latest",
                "server",
                "start"
                ]
            }
        }
    }
    ```
**Note:** When manually configuring Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code, use `servers` instead of `mcpServers` as the root object.

## Remote MCP Server (preview)

Microsoft Foundry and Microsoft Copilot Studio require remote MCP server endpoints. To self-host the Azure MCP Server for use with these platforms, deploy it as a remote MCP server on [Azure Container Apps](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/container-apps/overview).

### Microsoft Foundry

1. Follow the [deployment guide](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/tree/main/servers/Azure.Mcp.Server/azd-templates/aca-foundry-managed-identity/) for Microsoft Foundry.
2. See [Microsoft Foundry's MCP documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-foundry/agents/how-to/tools/model-context-protocol) for more details.

### Microsoft Copilot Studio

1. Follow the [deployment guide](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/tree/main/servers/Azure.Mcp.Server/azd-templates/aca-copilot-studio-managed-identity/) for Microsoft Copilot Studio.

# Usage

## Getting Started

1. Open GitHub Copilot in [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/chat-agent-mode) or [IntelliJ](https://github.blog/changelog/2025-05-19-agent-mode-and-mcp-support-for-copilot-in-jetbrains-eclipse-and-xcode-now-in-public-preview/#agent-mode) and switch to Agent mode.
1. Click `refresh` on the tools list
    - You should see the Azure MCP Server in the list of tools
1. Try a prompt that tells the agent to use the Azure MCP Server, such as `List my Azure Storage containers`
    - The agent should be able to use the Azure MCP Server tools to complete your query
1. Check out the [documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/developer/azure-mcp-server/) and review the [troubleshooting guide](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/blob/main/servers/Azure.Mcp.Server/TROUBLESHOOTING.md) for commonly asked questions
1. We're building this in the open. Your feedback is much appreciated, and will help us shape the future of the Azure MCP server

# Support and Reference

## Documentation

- See our [official documentation on learn.microsoft.com](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/developer/azure-mcp-server/) to learn how to use the Azure MCP Server to interact with Azure resources through natural language commands from AI agents and other types of clients.
- For additional command documentation and examples, see [Azure MCP Commands](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/blob/main/servers/Azure.Mcp.Server/docs/azmcp-commands.md).

## Feedback and Support

- Check the [Troubleshooting guide](https://aka.ms/azmcp/troubleshooting) to diagnose and resolve common issues with the Azure MCP Server.
- We're building this in the open. Your feedback is much appreciated, and will help us shape the future of the Azure MCP server.
    - 👉 [Open an issue](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/issues) in the public GitHub repository — we’d love to hear from you!

## Security

Your credentials are always handled securely through the official [Azure Identity SDK](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/blob/main/sdk/identity/Azure.Identity/README.md) - **we never store or manage tokens directly**.

MCP as a phenomenon is very novel and cutting-edge. As with all new technology standards, consider doing a security review to ensure any systems that integrate with MCP servers follow all regulations and standards your system is expected to adhere to. This includes not only the Azure MCP Server, but any MCP client/agent that you choose to implement down to the model provider.

You should follow Microsoft security guidance for MCP servers, including enabling Entra ID authentication, secure token management, and network isolation. Refer to [Microsoft Security Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/api-management/secure-mcp-servers) for details.

## Permissions and Risk

MCP clients can invoke operations based on the user’s Azure RBAC permissions. Autonomous or misconfigured clients may perform destructive actions. You should review and apply least-privilege RBAC roles and implement safeguards before deployment. Certain safeguards, such as flags to prevent destructive operations, are not standardized in the MCP specification and may not be supported by all clients.

## Data Collection

The software may collect information about you and your use of the software and send it to Microsoft. Microsoft may use this information to provide services and improve our products and services. You may turn off the telemetry as described in the repository. There are also some features in the software that may enable you and Microsoft to collect data from users of your applications. If you use these features, you must comply with applicable law, including providing appropriate notices to users of your applications together with a copy of Microsoft's [privacy statement](https://www.microsoft.com/privacy/privacystatement). You can learn more about data collection and use in the help documentation and our privacy statement. Your use of the software operates as your consent to these practices.

### Telemetry Configuration

Telemetry collection is on by default. The server supports two telemetry streams:

1. **User-provided telemetry**: If you configure your own Application Insights connection string via the `APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_CONNECTION_STRING` environment variable, telemetry will be sent to your Application Insights resource.

2. **Microsoft telemetry**: By default, telemetry is also sent to Microsoft to help improve the product. This can be disabled separately from user-provided telemetry. See [Disabling All Telemetry](#disabling-all-telemetry) section below for more details.

#### Disabling All Telemetry

To disable all telemetry collection (both user-provided and Microsoft), set the environment variable `AZURE_MCP_COLLECT_TELEMETRY` to `false`:

```bash
export AZURE_MCP_COLLECT_TELEMETRY=false
```

#### Disabling Microsoft Telemetry Only

To disable only Microsoft telemetry collection while keeping your own Application Insights telemetry active, set the environment variable `AZURE_MCP_COLLECT_TELEMETRY_MICROSOFT` to `false`:

```bash
export AZURE_MCP_COLLECT_TELEMETRY_MICROSOFT=false
```

## Compliance Responsibility

This MCP server may interact with clients and services outside Microsoft compliance boundaries. You are responsible for ensuring that any integration complies with applicable organizational, regulatory, and contractual requirements.

## Third Party Components

This MCP server may use or depend on third party components. You are responsible for reviewing and complying with the licenses and security posture of any third-party components.

## Export Control

Use of this software must comply with all applicable export laws and regulations, including U.S. Export Administration Regulations and local jurisdiction requirements.

## No Warranty / Limitation of Liability

This software is provided “as is” without warranties or conditions of any kind, either express or implied. Microsoft shall not be liable for any damages arising from use, misuse, or misconfiguration of this software.
