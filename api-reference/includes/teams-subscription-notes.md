### chatMessage

**chatMessage** subscriptions can be specified to include resource data. If specified to include resource data (**includeResourceData** set to `true`), [encryption](/graph/webhooks-with-resource-data) is required. The subscription creation fails if an [encryptionCertificate](/graph/api/resources/subscription) isn't specified for such subscriptions. Before you can create a **chatMessage** subscription with application permissions, you might need to request access. For details, see [Protected APIs in Microsoft Teams](/graph/teams-protected-apis).

You must use the `Prefer: include-unknown-enum-members` request header to get the following values in **chatMessage** **messageType** [evolvable enum](/graph/best-practices-concept#handling-future-members-in-evolvable-enumerations): `systemEventMessage` for `/teams/{id}/channels/{id}/messages` and `/chats/{id}/messages` resource.

> [!NOTE]
>`/teams/getAllMessages`, `/chats/getAllMessages`, `/me/chats/getAllMessages`, `/users/{id}/chats/getAllMessages`, and `/appCatalogs/teamsApps/{id}/installedToChats/getAllMessages` 
> have [licensing and payment requirements](/graph/teams-licenses).
> `/teams/getAllMessages` and `/chats/getAllMessages` support both `model=A` and `model=B` query parameters,
> `/me/chats/getAllMessages`, `/users/{id}/chats/getAllMessages`, and `/appCatalogs/teamsApps/{id}/installedToChats/getAllMessages`  support only `model=B`.
> If no model is specified, [evaluation mode](/graph/teams-licenses#evaluation-mode-default-requirements) will be used.

### conversationMember
**conversationMember** subscriptions can be specified to include resource data. If specified to include resource data (**includeResourceData** set to `true`), [encryption](/graph/webhooks-with-resource-data) is required. The subscription creation fails if an [encryptionCertificate](/graph/api/resources/subscription) isn't specified.

> [!NOTE]
>`/teams/getAllMembers`, `/chats/getAllMembers`, and `/appCatalogs/teamsApps/{id}/installedToChats/getAllMembers ` have [licensing and payment requirements](/graph/teams-licenses).
> `/teams/getAllMembers` and `/chats/getAllMembers` support both `model=A` and `model=B` query parameters. `/appCatalogs/teamsApps/{id}/installedToChats/getAllMembers` supports only `model=B`.
> If no model is specified, [evaluation mode](/graph/teams-licenses#evaluation-mode-default-requirements) will be used.

### team, channel, and chat
**team**, **channel**, and **chat** subscriptions can be specified to include resource data. If specified to include resource data (**includeResourceData** set to `true`), [encryption](/graph/webhooks-with-resource-data) is required. The subscription creation fails if an [encryptionCertificate](/graph/api/resources/subscription) isn't specified.

> [!NOTE]
>`/appCatalogs/teamsApps/{id}/installedToChats` has [licensing and payment requirements](/graph/teams-licenses), specifically supporting only `model=B`.
> If no model is specified, [evaluation mode](/graph/teams-licenses#evaluation-mode-default-requirements) will be used.
