> * The **region** property represents the organization's or the user's region. For users with multigeo licenses, the property contains the user's region (if available). For users without multigeo licenses, the property contains the organization's region.
> * The **region** value can be any region supported by the Teams payload. The possible values are: `Americas`, `Europe and MiddleEast`, `Asia Pacific`, `UAE`, `Australia`, `Brazil`, `Canada`, `Switzerland`, `Germany`, `France`, `India`, `Japan`, `South Korea`, `Norway`, `Singapore`, `United Kingdom`, `South Africa`, `Sweden`, `Qatar`, `Poland`, `Italy`, `Israel`, `Spain`, `Mexico`, `USGov Community Cloud`, `USGov Community Cloud High`, `USGov Department of Defense`, and `China`.
> * The **locale** property represents the location that a user has selected in Microsoft Teams and it doesn't follow the Office's locale setting. A userâ€™s locale is represented by their preferred language and country or region. For example, `en-us`. The language component follows two letter codes as defined in [ISO 639-1](https://www.iso.org/iso/home/standards/language_codes.htm), and the country component follows two letter codes as defined in [ISO 3166-1 alpha-2](https://www.iso.org/iso/country_codes.htm).
