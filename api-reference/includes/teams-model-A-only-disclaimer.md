> [!NOTE]
> When used with application permissions, this API is metered.  It supports the `model=A` payment model.  For details, see [Payment models](/graph/teams-licenses#payment-models). If you don't specify a payment model in your query, the default [evaluation mode](/graph/teams-licenses#evaluation-mode-default-requirements) will be used.
