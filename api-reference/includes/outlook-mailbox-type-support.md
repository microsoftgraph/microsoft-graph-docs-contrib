The Microsoft Graph API supports accessing data in users' _primary_ mailboxes and in [shared mailboxes](https://support.office.com/article/open-and-use-a-shared-mailbox-in-outlook-d94a8e9e-21f1-4240-808b-de9c9c088afd). The data can be calendar, mail, or personal contacts stored in a mailbox in the cloud on Exchange Online as part of Microsoft 365, or on Exchange on-premises in a [hybrid deployment](/graph/hybrid-rest-support).

The API does _not_ support accessing in-place archive mailboxes, not [on Exchange Online](/office365/servicedescriptions/exchange-online-archiving-service-description/archive-features#archive-mailbox) nor [on Exchange Server](/Exchange/policy-and-compliance/in-place-archiving/in-place-archiving?view=exchserver-2019).
