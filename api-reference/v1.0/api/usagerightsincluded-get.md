## HTTP request

```http
GET /security/dataSecurityAndGovernance/sensitivityLabels/{labelId}/rights
```

## Request headers

| Name                | Description                                                                                                                                 |
| :------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Authorization       | Bearer {token}. Required. Learn more about [authentication and authorization](/graph/auth/auth-concepts). |
| Client-Request-Id   | Optional. A client-generated GUID to trace the request. Recommended for troubleshooting.                                                  |

## Optional query parameters

This method supports some of the OData query parameters to help customize the response. For general information, see [OData query parameters](/graph/query-parameters).

## Request body

Don't supply a request body for this method.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and a collection of [usageRight](../resources/usagerights.md) enum values in the response body, representing the rights granted to the user for the specified label.

If the label is not found, doesn't have admin-defined protection, or the user doesn't have the `VIEW` right, the API might return an error response (for example, `403 Forbidden` or `404 Not Found`) with details in an [error object](/graph/errors).
