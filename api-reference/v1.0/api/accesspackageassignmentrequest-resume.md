# accessPackageAssignmentRequest: resume

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Resume a user's access package request after waiting for a callback from a custom extension.

In [Microsoft Entra entitlement management](../resources/entitlementmanagement-overview.md), when an access package policy has been enabled to call out a custom extension and the request processing is waiting for the callback from the customer, the customer can initiate a resume action. It's performed on an [accessPackageAssignmentRequest](../resources/accesspackageassignmentrequest.md) object whose **requestStatus** is in a `WaitingForCallback` state.
