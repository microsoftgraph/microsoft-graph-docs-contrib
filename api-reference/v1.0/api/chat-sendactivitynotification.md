### Example 2: Notify a user about an approval needed in a chat message

Similar to the previous example, this example uses `entityUrl` for the `topic`. However, in this case, it links to a message in the chat. The message can contain a card with the approval button on it.

#### Request
<!-- {
  "blockType": "request",
  "name": "chat_sendactivitynotification"
}
-->
``` http
POST https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/chats/{chatId}/sendActivityNotification
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "topic": {
        "source": "entityUrl",
        "value": "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/chats/{chatId}/messages/{messageId}"
    },
    "activityType": "approvalRequired",
    "previewText": {
        "content": "Deployment requires your approval"
    },
    "recipient": {
        "@odata.type": "Microsoft.Teams.GraphSvc.aadUserNotificationRecipient",
        "userId": "569363e2-4e49-4661-87f2-16f245c5d66a"
    },
    "templateParameters": [
        {
            "name": "approvalTaskId",
            "value": "2020AAGGTAPP"
        }
    ]
}
```

#### Response
<!-- {
  "blockType": "response",
  "truncated": false
}

``` http
HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
```

### Example 3: Notify a user about an event in relation to a chat

As shown in the previous examples, you can link to different aspects of the chat. However, if you want to link to an aspect that is not part of the chat, or is not represented by Microsoft Graph, you can set the source of the `topic` to `text` and pass in a custom value for it. Also, `webUrl` is required when setting `topic` source to `text`.
