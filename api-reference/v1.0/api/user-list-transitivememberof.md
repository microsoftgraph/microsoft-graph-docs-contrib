# List a user's memberships (direct and transitive)

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Get [groups](../resources/group.md), [directory roles](../resources/directoryrole.md), and [administrative units](../resources/administrativeunit.md) that the user is a member of through either direct or transitive membership.

[!INCLUDE [national-cloud-support](../../includes/all-clouds.md)]

## Permissions

Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](/graph/permissions-reference).

### Permissions for the signed-in user's memberships

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored"  } // Note: Removing this line will result in the permissions autogeneration tool overwriting the table. -->
[!INCLUDE [permissions-table](../includes/permissions/user-list-transitivememberof-permissions.md)]

### Permissions for another user's memberships

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored"  } // Note: Removing this line will result in the permissions autogeneration tool overwriting the table. -->
[!INCLUDE [permissions-table](../includes/permissions/user-list-transitivememberof-2-permissions.md)]

[!INCLUDE [limited-info](../../includes/limited-info.md)]

> [!TIP]
> - Calling the `/me/transitiveMemberOf` endpoint requires a signed-in user and therefore a delegated permission. Application permissions are not supported when you use the `/me/transitiveMemberOf` endpoint.
> - To list the members of a group with hidden membership, the `Member.Read.Hidden` permission is required.

## HTTP request

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
GET /me/transitiveMemberOf
```

[!INCLUDE [me-apis-sign-in-note](../includes/me-apis-sign-in-note.md)]

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
GET /users/{id | userPrincipalName}/transitiveMemberOf
```

## Optional query parameters

This method supports the `$filter`, `$count`, `$select`, `$search`, `$top` [OData query parameters](/graph/query-parameters) to help customize the response.
- OData cast is also enabled. For example, you can cast to get just the transitive membership in groups.
- `$search` is supported on the **displayName** property only.
- The default and maximum page size is 100 and 999 objects respectively.
- The use of query parameters with this API is supported only with advanced query parameters. For more information, see [Advanced query capabilities on directory objects](/graph/aad-advanced-queries).

## Request headers

| Header           | Value                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| :--------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|Authorization|Bearer {token}. Required. Learn more about [authentication and authorization](/graph/auth/auth-concepts).|
| ConsistencyLevel | eventual. This header and `$count` are required when using the `$search`, `$filter`, `$orderby`, or OData cast query parameters. It uses an index that might not be up-to-date with recent changes to the object. |

## Request body

Don't supply a request body for this method.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and collection of [directoryObject](../resources/directoryobject.md) objects in the response body.
