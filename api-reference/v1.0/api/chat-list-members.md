# List members of a chat

Namespace: microsoft.graph

List all [conversation members](../resources/conversationmember.md) in a [chat](../resources/chat.md).

This method supports federation. For one-on-one chats, at least one chat member must belong to the tenant the request initiates from. For group chats, the chat must be initiated by a user in the tenant the request initiates from.

> [!NOTE]
> The membership IDs returned by the server must be treated as opaque strings. The client should not try to parse or make any assumptions about these resource IDs.
>
> The membership results could map to users from different tenants, as indicated in the response, in the future. The client should not assume that all members are from the current tenant only.
