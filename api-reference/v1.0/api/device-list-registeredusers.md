# List registeredUsers

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Retrieve a list of users that are registered users of the device.

For cloud joined devices and registered personal devices, registered users are set to the same value as registered owners at the time of registration.

## Permissions
One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) | Device.Read.All, Directory.Read.All, Directory.ReadWrite.All    |

[!INCLUDE [limited-info](../../includes/limited-info.md)]

## HTTP request

You can address the device using either its **id** or **deviceId**.
<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
GET /devices/{id}/registeredUsers
GET /devices(deviceId='{deviceId}')/registeredUsers
```
## Optional query parameters
This method supports the `$search`, `$count`, and `$filter` [OData query parameters](/graph/query-parameters) to help customize the response. OData cast is also enabled, for example, you can cast to get just the directoryRoles the device is a member of. You can use `$search` on the **displayName** property.

Some queries are supported only when you use the **ConsistencyLevel** header set to `eventual` and `$count`. For more information, see [Advanced query capabilities on Azure AD directory objects](/graph/aad-advanced-queries).

When items are added or updated for this resource, they are specially indexed for use with the `$count` and `$search` query parameters. There can be a slight delay between when an item is added or updated and when it is available in the index.

## Request headers
| Name       | Type | Description|
|:-----------|:------|:----------|
| Authorization  | string  | Bearer {token}. Required. |

## Request body
Do not supply a request body for this method.
