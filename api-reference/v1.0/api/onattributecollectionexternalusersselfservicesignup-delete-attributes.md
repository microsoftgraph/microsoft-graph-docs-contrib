# Remove attribute (from user flow)
Namespace: microsoft.graph

Remove an attribute from an external identities self-service sign up user flow that's represented by an [externalUsersSelfServiceSignupEventsFlow](../resources/externalusersselfservicesignupeventsflow.md) object. You can add both custom and built-in attributes to a user flow.

The attribute is removed from both the **onAttributeCollection** > **attributes** and **onAttributeCollection** > **attributeCollectionPage** > **views** collections of the user flow.

This API operation fails when you attempt to remove the last remaining attribute on the user flow.
