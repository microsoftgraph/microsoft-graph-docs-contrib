## Permissions

Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types).

## HTTP request

You can address the service principal using either its **id** or **appId**. **id** and **appId** are referred to as the **Object ID** and **Application (Client) ID**, respectively, in app registrations in the Microsoft Entra admin center.

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->

```http
DELETE /servicePrincipals/{id}/appRoleAssignedTo/{appRoleAssignment-id}
DELETE /servicePrincipals(appId='{appId}')/appRoleAssignedTo/{appRoleAssignment-id}
```

> [!NOTE]
> As a best practice, we recommend you use this method to delete app role assignments, instead of the [Delete appRoleAssignments ](serviceprincipal-delete-approleassignments.md) method which deletes through the **appRoleAssignments** relationship of the assigned user, group, or service principal.
