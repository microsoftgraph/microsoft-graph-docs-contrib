# call: reject

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Enable a bot to reject an incoming call. The incoming call request can be an invite from a participant in a group call or a peer-to-peer call. If an invite to a group call is received, the notification will contain the **chatInfo** and **meetingInfo** parameters.

The bot is expected to answer or reject the call before the call times out. The current timeout value is 15 seconds.

This API does not end existing calls that have already been answered. Use [delete call](../api/call-delete.md) to end a call.
