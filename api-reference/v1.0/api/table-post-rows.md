# Create TableRow

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Adds rows to the end of a table. 

Note that this API can accept multiple rows of data. Adding one row at a time can affect performance. The recommended approach is to batch the rows together in a single call rather than inserting single rows. For best results, collect the rows to be inserted on the application side and perform a single row add operation. Experiment with the number of rows to determine the ideal number of rows to use in a single API call. 

This request might occasionally result in a `504 HTTP` error. The appropriate response to this error is to repeat the request.

## Permissions

Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](/graph/permissions-reference).

## HTTP request
<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
POST /me/drive/items/{id}/workbook/tables/{id|name}/rows
POST /me/drive/root:/{item-path}:/workbook/tables/{id|name}/rows

POST /me/drive/root:/{item-path}:/workbook/worksheets/{id|name}/tables/{id|name}/rows
```

## Request headers

| Name | Description |
|:---------------|:----------|
|Authorization|Bearer {token}. Required. Learn more about [authentication and authorization](/graph/auth/auth-concepts).|
| Content-Type | application/json. Required.|
| Prefer  | respond-async. Indicates that the request is an async request. Optional.  |
| Workbook-Session-Id  | {Workbook-Session-Id}. Created from the **createSession** request. Optional.|

## Request body

In the request body, provide a JSON object with the following parameters.

|Parameter|Type|Description|
|:---------------|:--------|:----------|
| index| Int32| Optional. Specifies the relative position of the new row. If null, the addition happens at the end. Any rows below the inserted row are shifted downwards. Zero-indexed.|
| values| [Json](../resources/json.md)| A two-dimensional array of unformatted values of the table rows.|

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `201 Created` response code and a [workbookTableRow](../resources/workbooktablerow.md) object in the response body.

## Examples

### Example 1: Add two rows to a table

In this example, two rows of data are inserted at the end of the table.

### Example 2: Add two rows to a table asynchronously

Async requests will be useful if the request takes longer time than expected. Note that the `Workbook-Session-Id` header is required when issuing async requests. The user needs to [Create session](./workbook-createsession.md) before using async rich API features. The header `Prefer:respond-async` is also required in the async requests.

For async features, the user usually needs to issue two or three requests: this request, [Get workbookOperation](./workbookoperation-get.md), and optionally [Get tableRowOperationResult](./workbook-tablerowoperationresult.md).

#### Request

Here is an example of the async request. Note that `202 Accepted` will only happen when the request takes a long time to respond. If the request is completed quickly, it will work like a regular sync request, falling back to [Example 1](#example-1-add-two-rows-to-a-table).

#### Response

Here is another example of the response that will lead to an async operation. For details, see [Get workbookOperation](./workbookoperation-get.md) and [Get tableRowOperationResult](./workbook-tablerowoperationresult.md).
