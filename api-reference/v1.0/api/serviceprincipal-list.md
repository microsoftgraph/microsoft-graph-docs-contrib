```
## Optional query parameters

This method supports the `$count`, `$expand`, `$filter`, `$orderBy`, `$search`, `$select`, and `$top` [OData query parameters](/graph/query-parameters) to help customize the response. Some queries are supported only when you use the **ConsistencyLevel** header set to `eventual` and `$count`. For more information, see [Advanced query capabilities on Azure AD directory objects](/graph/aad-advanced-queries).

## Request headers
| Name           | Description                |
|:---------------|:---------------------------|
| Authorization  | Bearer {token}. Required.  |
| ConsistencyLevel | eventual. This header and `$count` are required when using `$search`, or when using `$filter` with the `$orderby` query parameter. It uses an index that may not be up-to-date with recent changes to the object. |

## Request body

Do not supply a request body for this method.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and collection of [servicePrincipal](../resources/serviceprincipal.md) objects in the response body.

## Examples

<!-- {
  "blockType": "response",
  "truncated": true,
  "@odata.type": "microsoft.graph.servicePrincipal",
  "isCollection": true
} -->

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-type: application/json

{
  "value": [
    {
      "accountEnabled":true,
      "displayName":"amasf",
      "servicePrincipalType":"Application",
      "signInAudience":"AzureADMyOrg"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Example 2: Get only a count of service principals

#### Request

The following is an example of the request. This request requires the **ConsistencyLevel** header set to `eventual` because `$count` is in the request. For more information about the use of **ConsistencyLevel** and `$count`, see [Advanced query capabilities on Azure AD directory objects](/graph/aad-advanced-queries).

<!-- {
  "blockType": "ignored",
  "name": "get_count_only"
}-->
```msgraph-interactive
GET https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/servicePrincipals/$count
ConsistencyLevel: eventual
```

#### Response

The following is an example of the response.

<!-- {
  "blockType": "response"
} -->
```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-type: text/plain

893
```

### Example 3: Use $filter and $top to get one service principal with a display name that starts with 'a' including a count of returned objects

#### Request

The following is an example of the request. This request requires the **ConsistencyLevel** header set to `eventual` and the `$count=true` query string because the request has both the `$orderBy` and `$filter` query parameters. For more information about the use of **ConsistencyLevel** and `$count`, see [Advanced query capabilities on Azure AD directory objects](/graph/aad-advanced-queries).


# [HTTP](#tab/http)
<!-- {
  "blockType": "request",
  "name": "get_a_count"
}-->
```msgraph-interactive
GET https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/servicePrincipals?$filter=startswith(displayName, 'a')&$count=true&$top=1&$orderby=displayName
ConsistencyLevel: eventual

### Example 4: Use $search to get service principals with display names that contain the letters 'Team' including a count of returned objects

#### Request

The following is an example of the request. This request requires the **ConsistencyLevel** header set to `eventual` because `$search` and the `$count=true` query string is in the request.
