# List events

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Retrieve a list of events in a calendar.  The calendar can be one for a [user](../resources/user.md), or the default calendar of a Microsoft 365 [group](../resources/group.md). The list of events contains single instance meetings and series masters.

To get expanded event instances, you can [get the calendar view](calendar-list-calendarview.md), or 
[get the instances of an event](event-list-instances.md).

| user calendar | Calendars.Read, Calendars.ReadWrite | Calendars.Read, Calendars.ReadWrite | Calendars.Read, Calendars.ReadWrite |
