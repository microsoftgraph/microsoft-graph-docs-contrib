# Create permissionGrantConditionSet in includes collection of permissionGrantPolicy

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Add conditions under which a permission grant event is *included* in a permission grant policy. You do this by adding a [permissionGrantConditionSet](../resources/permissiongrantconditionset.md) to the **includes** collection of a  [permissionGrantPolicy](../resources/permissionGrantPolicy.md).

[!INCLUDE [national-cloud-support](../../includes/all-clouds.md)]

## Permissions

Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](/graph/permissions-reference).

[!INCLUDE [permissions-table](../includes/permissions/permissiongrantpolicy-post-includes-permissions.md)]

## HTTP request

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->

```http
POST /policies/permissionGrantPolicies/{id}/includes
```

## Request headers

| Name       | Description|
|:-----------|:----------|
|Authorization|Bearer {token}. Required. Learn more about [authentication and authorization](/graph/auth/auth-concepts).|
| Content-type | application/json. Required. |

## Request body

In the request body, supply a JSON representation of an [permissionGrantConditionSet](../resources/permissiongrantconditionset.md) object.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `201 Created` response code and an [permissionGrantConditionSet](../resources/permissiongrantconditionset.md) object in the response body.

## Examples

### Request

In this example, *all* delegated permissions for client apps from verified publishers are included in the permission grant policy. Because all the other conditions from the [permissionGrantConditionSet](../resources/permissiongrantconditionset.md) were omitted, they will take their default values, which in each case is the most-inclusive.
