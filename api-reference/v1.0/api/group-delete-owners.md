# Remove group owner

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Remove an owner from a Microsoft 365 [group](../resources/group.md) or a security group through the **owners** navigation property. Once owners are assigned to a group, the last owner (a user object) of the group cannot be removed.

## Permissions

Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](/graph/permissions-reference).

[!INCLUDE [permissions-table](../includes/permissions/group-delete-owners-permissions.md)]

In delegated scenarios, the signed-in user must also be assigned a supported [Microsoft Entra role](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference?toc=%2Fgraph%2Ftoc.json) or a custom role with the required role permission. The following least privileged roles are supported for this operation:
