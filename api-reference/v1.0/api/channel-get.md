# Get channel

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Retrieve the properties and relationships of a [channel](../resources/channel.md).

This method supports federation. Only a user who is a member of the shared channel can retrieve channel information.

[!INCLUDE [national-cloud-support](../../includes/all-clouds.md)]

## Permissions

Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](/graph/permissions-reference).

This API supports admin permissions. Microsoft Teams service admins can access teams that they aren't a member of.

[!INCLUDE [permissions-table](../includes/permissions/channel-get-permissions.md)]

> [!NOTE]
> - The ChannelSettings.Read.Group and ChannelSettings.ReadWrite.Group permissions use [resource-specific consent](/microsoftteams/platform/graph-api/rsc/resource-specific-consent).
> - The Group.Read.All, Group.ReadWrite.All, Directory.Read.All, and Directory.ReadWrite.All permissions are supported only for backward compatibility. We recommend that you update your solutions to use an alternative permission listed in the previous table and avoid using these permissions going forward.


## HTTP request
<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
GET /teams/{team-id}/channels/{channel-id}
```

## Optional query parameters

This method supports the `$filter` and `$select` [OData query parameters](/graph/query-parameters) to help customize the response.

### Use $select for better performance

Populating the **email** and **summary** property for a channel is an expensive operation that results in slow performance. Use `$select` to exclude the **email** and **summary** property to improve performance.

> **Note**: The summary property can only be retrieved via the `select` parameter, as shown in Example 2 in this topic.

## Request headers

| Header       | Value |
|:---------------|:--------|
|Authorization|Bearer {token}. Required. Learn more about [authentication and authorization](/graph/auth/auth-concepts).|

## Request body

Don't supply a request body for this method.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and a [channel](../resources/channel.md) object in the response body.
