# directoryObject: getMemberGroups

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Return all the group IDs for the groups that the specified [user](../resources/user.md), [group](../resources/group.md), [service principal](../resources/serviceprincipal.md), [organizational contact](../resources/orgcontact.md), [device](../resources/device.md), or [directory object](../resources/directoryobject.md) is a member of. This function is transitive.

This API returns up to 11,000 group IDs. If more than 11,000 results are available, it returns a `400 Bad Request` error with the `Directory_ResultSizeLimitExceeded` error code. If you get the `Directory_ResultSizeLimitExceeded` error code, use the [List group transitive memberOf](../api/group-list-transitivememberof.md) API instead.

[!INCLUDE [national-cloud-support](../../includes/all-clouds.md)]

## Permissions
One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).


### Group memberships for a directory object

Here, the permission allows you to read *any* directory object, regardless of the object type. To scope the operation to a specific object type and use lesser-privileged permissions, refer to other permissions tables on this page.

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored"  } // Note: Removing this line will result in the permissions autogeneration tool overwriting the table. -->
|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) | Directory.Read.All    |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported.    |
|Application | Directory.Read.All |

### Group memberships for a user

[!INCLUDE [permissions-table](../includes/permissions/directoryobject-getmembergroups-6-permissions.md)]

<!--

Use the follow scenario guidance to help determine which permission types to use:

| Scenario | Permissions to use |
|:-|:-|
| To get group memberships for the signed-in user | Use one of the following sets of permissions: <br/> <li> **User.Read** and **GroupMember.Read.All** <li>**User.Read** and **Group.Read.All** |
| To get group memberships for any user | Use one of the following sets of permissions: <br/> <li> **User.ReadBasic.All** and **GroupMember.Read.All** <li>**User.Read.All** and **GroupMember.Read.All** <li>**User.ReadBasic.All** and **Group.Read.All** <li>**User.Read.All** and **Group.Read.All** |
| To get group memberships for a group | Use either the **GroupMember.Read.All** or **Group.Read.All** permission. |
| To get group memberships for a directory object | Use the **Directory.Read.All** permission. |

<!-- These tables will replace the data in lines 22-36 to help with the tooling that parses permissions tables.
+ Current data is copy-pasted from incorrect files/file names
+ To validate these permissions against lines 32-36
-->
