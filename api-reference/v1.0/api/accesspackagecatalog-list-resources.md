### Example 3: Retrieve the roles and scopes of a single resource in a catalog by origin ID

#### Request

The following is an example of the request, using `$expand` to return the roles and scopes of a single resource.  The filter uses the `originId` property of the [accessPackageResource](../resources/accesspackageresource.md) to refer to the identifier in the origin system. If the resource in the catalog is based on a [group](../resources/group.md), this value would be the `id` of that group.
