## HTTP request
<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
GET /devices
```
## Optional query parameters

This method supports the [OData query parameters](/graph/query-parameters) to help customize the response, including `$search`, `$count`, and `$filter`. You can use `$search` on the **displayName** and **description** properties. When items are added or updated for this resource, they are specially indexed for use with the `$count` and `$search` query parameters. There can be a slight delay between when an item is added or updated and when it is available in the index.

## Request headers

| Name       |  Description|
|:-----------|:------------|
| Authorization  | Bearer {token}. Required. |
| ConsistencyLevel | eventual. This header and `$count` are required when using `$search`, or when using `$filter` with the `$orderby` query parameter. It uses an index that may not be up-to-date with recent changes to the object. |

## Request body
Do not supply a request body for this method.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and collection of [device](../resources/device.md) objects in the response body.
