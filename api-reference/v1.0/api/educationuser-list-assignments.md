# List assignments of a user

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Returns a list of [educationAssignment](../resources/educationassignment.md) assigned to a [educationUser](../resources/educationuser.md) for all [classes](../resources/educationclass.md). Only teachers, students, and applications with application permissions can perform this operation.

This method allows a caller to find all the **assignments** belonging to a student or a teacher in a single call rather than having to request **assignments** from each **class**. The **assignment** list contains what is needed to get the detailed information for the **assignment** from within the **class** namespace. Use the methods defined for the **assignment** for all other operations.

> **Note:** The `instructions`, `assignedDateTime`, `assignTo`, `resourcesFolderUrl` and `webUrl` properties will always display null.

[!INCLUDE [national-cloud-support](../../includes/global-only.md)]

## Permissions
Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](/graph/permissions-reference).

<!-- { "blockType": "permissions", "name": "educationuser_list_assignments" } -->
[!INCLUDE [permissions-table](../includes/permissions/educationuser-list-assignments-permissions.md)]

Calling the `/me` endpoint requires a signed-in user and therefore delegated permissions. Application permissions aren't supported when using the `/me` endpoint.

The `/users/{user-id}` endpoint works with delegated and application permissions.

## HTTP request

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->

```http
GET /education/me/assignments
GET /education/users/{user-id}/assignments
```

## Optional query parameters

This method supports the `$top`, `$filter`, `$orderby`, and `$select` OData query parameters to help customize the response. For general information, see [OData query parameters](/graph/query-parameters).

All [properties](../resources/educationassignment.md#properties) are supported for the query parameters `$filter` and `$orderby`.

## Request headers

| Header        | Value                     |
| :------------ | :------------------------ |
|Authorization|Bearer {token}. Required. Learn more about [authentication and authorization](/graph/auth/auth-concepts).|

## Request body

Don't supply a request body for this method.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and a collection of [educationAssignment](../resources/educationassignment.md) objects in the response body.
