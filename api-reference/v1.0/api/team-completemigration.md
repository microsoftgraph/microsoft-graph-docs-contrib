# team: completeMigration

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Complete the message migration process by removing `migration mode` from a [team](../resources/team.md). `Migration mode` is a special state where certain operations are barred, like message POST and membership operations during the data migration process.

After a **completeMigration** request is made, you can't import additional messages into the team. You can add members to the team after the request returns a successful response.
