# List contactedReviewers
Namespace: microsoft.graph

Get the reviewers for an [access review instance](../resources/accessreviewinstance.md), irrespective of whether or not they have received a notification. The reviewers are represented by an [accessReviewReviewer](../resources/accessreviewreviewer.md) object. A list of zero or more objects are returned, including all of their nested properties.
