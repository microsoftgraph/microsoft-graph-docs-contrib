# group: getMemberGroups

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Return all the groups that the specified group is a member of. The check is transitive, unlike reading the [memberOf](../api/group-list-memberof.md) navigation property, which returns only the groups that the group is a direct member of.

This function supports Microsoft 365 and other types of groups provisioned in Azure AD. The maximum number of groups each
request can return is 2046. Note that Microsoft 365 groups cannot contain groups. So membership in a Microsoft 365 group is
always direct.
