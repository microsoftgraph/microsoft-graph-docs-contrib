# Update educationOutcome

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Update the properties of an [educationOutcome](../resources/educationoutcome.md) object. Only teachers can perform this operation.

[!INCLUDE [national-cloud-support](../../includes/global-only.md)]

## Permissions

Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](/graph/permissions-reference).

<!-- { "blockType": "permissions", "name": "educationoutcome_update" } -->
[!INCLUDE [permissions-table](../includes/permissions/educationoutcome-update-permissions.md)]

## HTTP request

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->

```http
PATCH /education/classes/{class-id}/assignments/{assignment-id}/submissions/{submission-id}/outcomes/{outcome-id}
```

## Request headers

| Name       | Description|
|:-----------|:-----------|
|Authorization|Bearer {token}. Required. Learn more about [authentication and authorization](/graph/auth/auth-concepts).|

## Request body

In the request body, supply only the values of the fields you want to update.

Existing properties that are not included in the request body will maintain their previous values or be recalculated based on changes to other property values. For best performance, don't include existing values that haven't changed.

The **educationOutcome** object will be one of the following derived types: **educationPointsOutcome**, **educationFeedbackOutcome**, or **educationRubricOutcome**. Supply the specific properties relevant to the type of outcome you're updating.

All derived outcome types have a regular and a "published" property appropriate to that type of outcome; for example, **points** and **publishedPoints**, **feedback** and **publishedFeedback**. Don't update the "published" property; it is for internal use. For example, to assign points to an **educationPointsOutcome**, update the **points** property, but don't update **publishedPoints**.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and an updated [educationOutcome](../resources/educationoutcome.md) object in the response body.

If **pointsGradeType** and **points** are updated to a negative or infinite value, the method returns a `400` error message.

```http
HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
Content-type: application/json

{
	"error": {
		"code": "badRequest",
		"message": "Bad request.",
		"innerError": {
			"code": "invalidGrading",
			"message": "Points must be less than 9999999 when using PointsGradeType."
		}
	}
}
```

If an invalid outcome ID is specified, a `404 Not Found` error is returned.

```http
HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
Content-type: application/json

{
	"error": {
		"code": "20241",
		"message": "Entity not found. Outcome id: 05d0f76c-1dfa-4442-926c-1b094828b505"
	}
}
```
