|:-----------|:------|:----------|
| Authorization  | string  | Bearer {token}. Required. |

## Request body

In the request body, supply the values for relevant fields that should be updated. Existing properties that are not included in the request body will maintain their previous values or be recalculated based on changes to other property values. For best performance you shouldn't include existing values that haven't changed.

| Property   | Type |Description|
|:---------------|:--------|:----------|
|allowExternalSenders|Boolean|Default is `false`. Indicates whether people external to the organization can send messages to the group.|
|autoSubscribeNewMembers|Boolean|Default is `false`. Indicates whether new members added to the group will be auto-subscribed to receive email notifications. **autoSubscribeNewMembers** can't be `true` when **subscriptionEnabled** is set to `false` on the group.|
|description|String|An optional description for the group. |
|displayName|String|The display name for the group. This property is required when a group is created and it cannot be cleared during updates. |
|groupTypes|String collection|Specifies the group type and its membership.  <br><br>If the collection contains **Unified** then the group is a Microsoft 365 group; otherwise it's a security group.  <br><br>If the collection includes **DynamicMembership**, the group has dynamic membership; otherwise, membership is static. |
|mailEnabled|Boolean|Specifies whether the group is mail-enabled.|
|mailNickname|String|The mail alias for the group. This property must be specified when a group is created. |
|securityEnabled|Boolean|Specifies whether the group is a security group. |

> **Note:**
>
> - To update the following Exchange-specific properties, you must specify them in their own PATCH request, without including the other properties listed in the table above: **allowExternalSenders**, **autoSubscribeNewMembers**, **hideFromAddressLists**, **hideFromOutlookClients**, **isSubscribedByMail**, **unseenCount**.
> - Only a subset of the group API pertaining to core group administration and management support application and delegated permissions. All other members of the group API, including updating  **autoSubscribeNewMembers**, support only delegated permissions. See [known issues](/graph/known-issues#groups) for examples.
> - The rules for updating mail-enabled security groups in Microsoft Exchange Server can be complex; to learn more, see [Manage mail-enabled security groups in Exchange Server](/Exchange/recipients/mail-enabled-security-groups?view=exchserver-2019).
