# Delete open extension

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Delete an open extension ([openTypeExtension](../resources/opentypeextension.md) object) from the specified instance of a resource. 

See the table in the [Permissions](#permissions) section for the list of resources that support open extensions.

## Permissions

Depending on the resource you're deleting the extension from and the permission type (delegated or application) requested, the permission specified in the following table is the least privileged required to call this API. To learn more, including [taking caution](/graph/auth/auth-concepts#best-practices-for-requesting-permissions) before choosing more privileged permissions, search for the following permissions in [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

| Supported resource | Delegated (work or school account) | Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Application |
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| [device](../resources/device.md) | Directory.AccessAsUser.All | Not supported | Device.ReadWrite.All |
| [event](../resources/event.md) | Calendars.ReadWrite | Calendars.ReadWrite | Calendars.ReadWrite |
| [group](../resources/group.md) | Group.ReadWrite.All | Not supported | Group.ReadWrite.All |
| [group event](../resources/event.md) | Group.ReadWrite.All | Not supported | Not supported |
| [group post](../resources/post.md) | Group.ReadWrite.All | Not supported | Group.ReadWrite.All |
| [message](../resources/message.md) | Mail.ReadWrite | Mail.ReadWrite | Mail.ReadWrite | 
| [organization](../resources/organization.md) | Organization.ReadWrite.All | Not supported | Organization.ReadWrite.All |
| [personal contact](../resources/contact.md) | Contacts.ReadWrite | Contacts.ReadWrite | Contacts.ReadWrite |
| [user](../resources/user.md) | User.ReadWrite | User.ReadWrite | User.ReadWrite.All |
| [task](../resources/todotask.md) | Tasks.ReadWrite | Tasks.ReadWrite | Tasks.ReadWrite.All |
| [tasklist](../resources/todotasklist.md)  | Tasks.ReadWrite | Tasks.ReadWrite | Tasks.ReadWrite.All |

## HTTP request
In the request, identify the resource instance, use the **extensions** 
navigation property of that instance to identify the extension, and do a `DELETE` on that extension instance.

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
DELETE /devices/{Id}/extensions/{extensionId}
DELETE /users/{id|userPrincipalName}/events/{id}/extensions/{extensionId}
DELETE /groups/{id}/extensions/{extensionId}
DELETE /groups/{id}/events/{id}/extensions/{extensionId}
DELETE /groups/{id}/threads/{id}/posts/{id}/extensions/{extensionId}
DELETE /users/{id|userPrincipalName}/messages/{id}/extensions/{extensionId}
DELETE /organization/{Id}/extensions/{extensionId}
DELETE /users/{id|userPrincipalName}/contacts/{id}/extensions/{extensionId}
DELETE /users/{id|userPrincipalName}/extensions/{extensionId}
DELETE /users/me/todo/lists/{todoTaskListId}/extensions/{extensionId}
DELETE /users/me/todo/lists/{todoTaskListId}/tasks/{taskId}/extensions/{extensionId}
```

>**Note:** The above syntax shows some common ways to identify a resource instance, in order to delete an extension from it. 
All other syntax that allows you to identify these resource instances supports deleting open extensions from them in a similar way.

## Path parameters
|Parameter|Type|Description|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|id|string|A unique identifier for an instance in the corresponding collection. Required.|
|extensionId|string|This can be an extension name which is a unique text identifier for the extension, or a fully qualified name which concatenates the extension type and unique text identifier. The fully qualified name is returned in the `id` property when you create the extension. Required.|

## Request headers
| Name       | Value |
|:---------------|:----------|
| Authorization | Bearer {token}. Required. |

## Request body
Do not supply a request body for this method.

## Response

If successful, this method returns `204 No Content` response code. It does not return anything in the response body.
