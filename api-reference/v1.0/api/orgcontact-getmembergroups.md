# orgContact: getMemberGroups

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Return all the groups that the [organizational contact](../resources/orgcontact.md) is a member of. The check is transitive, unlike reading the **memberOf** navigation property, which returns only the groups that the user is a direct member of.

This function supports Microsoft 365 and other types of groups provisioned in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). The maximum number of groups each request can return is 2046. 

>[!NOTE]
>Microsoft 365 groups cannot contain groups. Membership in a Microsoft 365 group is always direct.
