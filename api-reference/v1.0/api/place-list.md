# List places

Namespace: microsoft.graph


Get a collection of the specified type of [place](../resources/place.md) objects defined in the tenant. For example, you can get all the rooms, all the room lists, or the rooms in a specific room list in the tenant.

>**Note:** Rooms that are marked "Hidden from GAL" can't be retrieved through this endpoint.

A **place** object can be one of the following types:

* A [room](../resources/room.md) which includes rich properties such as an email address for the room, and accessibility, capacity, and device support.
* A [room list](../resources/roomlist.md) which includes an email address for the room list, and a navigation property to get the collection of room instances in the room list.

Both **room** and **roomList** are derived from the **place** object.

By default, this operation returns 100 places per page.

Compared with the [findRooms](/graph/api/user-findrooms) and [findRoomLists](/graph/api/user-findroomlists) functions, this operation returns a richer payload for rooms and room lists. See [details](../resources/place.md#using-the-places-api) for how they compare.

Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](/graph/permissions-reference).
