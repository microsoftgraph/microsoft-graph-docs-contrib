# List used

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Calculate and list the documents that a user has viewed or modified. 

For the signed-in user:
- This method includes documents that the user has modified; see [example 1](#example-1-return-documents-that-user-has-modified). 
- Using an `$orderby` query parameter on the **lastAccessedDateTime** property returns the most recently viewed documents that the user might or might not not have modified; see [example 2](#example-2-return-the-most-recently-viewed-documents-that-the-signed-in-user-might-or-might-not-have-modified).

For other users, this method includes only documents that the user has modified.

## Permissions
Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](/graph/permissions-reference).

[!INCLUDE [permissions-table](../includes/permissions/insights-list-used-permissions.md)]

## HTTP request

- Get a list of documents that the signed-in user has modified:
  <!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
  ```http
  GET /me/insights/used
  ```

- Get a list of documents that the specified user has modified:
  <!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
  ```http
  GET /users/{id | userPrincipalName}/insights/used
  ```
  >**Note**: Requesting another user's **used** documents returns results sorted by **lastModifiedDateTime**. **lastAccessedDateTime** is then set to **lastModifiedDateTime**.


- Expand the resource referenced by a **used** insight:
  <!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
  ```http
  GET /me/insights/used/{id}/resource
  GET /users/{id | userPrincipalName}/insights/used/{id}/resource
  ```


## Optional query parameters
This method supports the [OData query parameters](/graph/query-parameters) to help customize the response:

- Use the `$filter` query parameter to filter used items. For example, based on **type**:
  <!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
  `https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me/insights/used?$filter=ResourceVisualization/Type eq 'PowerPoint'`

- Use `$filter` to filter used items based on  **containerType**:
  <!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
  `https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me/insights/used?$filter=ResourceVisualization/containerType eq 'OneDriveBusiness'`

  See the available container types and types you can filter by in [resourceVisualization](../resources/insights-resourcevisualization.md).

- Use the `$orderby` query parameter to sort documents last viewed or modified _by the signed-in user_, based on the **lastAccessedDateTime** property:
  <!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
  `https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me/insights/used?$orderby=LastUsed/LastAccessedDateTime desc`

  >**Note**: Use this query option _only for the signed-in user_. You cannot use this API to get documents viewed or modified by another user. See [example 2](#example-2-return-the-most-recently-viewed-documents-that-the-signed-in-user-might-or-might-not-have-modified).
