## HTTP request

To retrieve the direct reports of a user:
<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
GET /me/directReports
GET /users/{id | userPrincipalName}/directReports
```

To retrieve the user and their direct reports, use the `$expand` query parameter:

>**Note**: `$expand` returns a maximum of 20 objects. For details, see [query parameter limitations](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/known-issues/?search=13635).

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
GET /me?$expand=directReports
GET /users/{id | userPrincipalName}?$expand=directReports
```

## Optional query parameters

This method supports the `$select`, `$count`, `$expand`, and `$filter` [OData query parameters](/graph/query-parameters) to help customize the response. You can use `$select` nested in the `$expand` expression. For example, `me?$expand=($select=id,displayName)`. Some queries are supported only when you use the **ConsistencyLevel** header set to `eventual` and `$count`. For more information, see [Advanced query capabilities on directory objects](/graph/aad-advanced-queries).

## Request headers
| Header       | Value|
|:-----------|:------|
|Authorization|Bearer {token}. Required. Learn more about [authentication and authorization](/graph/auth/auth-concepts).|
| Content-Type   | application/json  |
| ConsistencyLevel | eventual. This header and `$count` are required when using `$search`, or in specific usage of `$filter`. For more information about the use of **ConsistencyLevel** and `$count`, see [Advanced query capabilities on directory objects](/graph/aad-advanced-queries). |
