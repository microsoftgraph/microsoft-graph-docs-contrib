# Delete educationAssignmentResource

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Delete a specific [educationAssignmentResource](../resources/educationassignmentresource.md) attached to an assignment.

In general, only teachers in the class can remove a resource. However, teachers can't remove resources marked as "distributeToStudents", after the assignment has been published to students.
