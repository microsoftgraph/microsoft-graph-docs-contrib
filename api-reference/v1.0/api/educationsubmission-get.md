# Get educationSubmission

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Retrieve a particular [submission](../resources/educationsubmission.md). Only teachers, students, and applications with application permissions can perform this operation.

A **submission** object represents a student's work for an [assignment](../resources/educationassignment.md). Resources associated with the **submission** represent this work.

Only the **assignedTo** student can see and modify the **submission**. A teacher or application with application permissions has full access to all **submissions**.

The grade and feedback from a teacher are part of the [educationOutcome](../resources/educationoutcome.md) associated with this object. Only teachers or applications with application permissions can add or change grades and feedback. Students will not see the grade or feedback until the **assignment** has been released.

[!INCLUDE [national-cloud-support](../../includes/global-only.md)]
