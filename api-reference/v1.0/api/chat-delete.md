# Delete chat
Namespace: microsoft.graph

Soft-delete a [chat](../resources/chat.md). When invoked with delegated permissions, this operation only works for tenant admins and Teams service admins.

> **Notes:** 
> This operation is not supported for non-admin users.
> Only tenant admins for the user who initiated the chat can delete the chat. For example, if a user from tenant A creates a thread and then adds a user from tenant B, only the admin from tenant A can delete the thread.
> This API deletes 1:1 chats, meeting chats, and group chat threads. It does not delete channel chat threads.
> After chats are deleted, tenant admins have seven days to restore them. Chats deleted for more than seven days can't be restored.
> One delete request per second per tenant is allowed.
