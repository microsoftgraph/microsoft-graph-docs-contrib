# Add directory role member

Namespace: microsoft.graph

> [!NOTE]
> Microsoft recommends that you use the unified RBAC API instead of this API. The unified RBAC API provides more functionality and flexibility. For more information, see [Create unifiedRoleAssignment](./rbacapplication-post-roleassignments.md).

Create a new directory role member.

You can use both the object ID and template ID of the **directoryRole** with this API. The template ID of a built-in role is immutable and can be seen in the role description on the Microsoft Entra admin center. For details, see [Role template IDs](/azure/active-directory/users-groups-roles/directory-assign-admin-roles#role-template-ids).

[!INCLUDE [national-cloud-support](../../includes/all-clouds.md)]

## Permissions
Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](/graph/permissions-reference).
