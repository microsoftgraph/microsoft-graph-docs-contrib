# Delete a user

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Delete user.  

When deleted, user resources are moved to a temporary container and can be restored within 30 days.  After that time, they are permanently deleted.  To learn more, see [deletedItems](../resources/directory.md).

## Permissions

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) | Directory.AccessAsUser.All    |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported.    |
|Application | User.ReadWrite.All |

The work or school account must be in one of the following roles:
+ Global Administrator
+ User Administrator

Only a Global Administrator can delete a user in a Global Administrator role  or _any_ user in the tenant. A User Administrator can only delete users who are non-administrators or in specific limited roles. For more details, see [Administrator role permissions in Azure AD](/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference#available-roles).
