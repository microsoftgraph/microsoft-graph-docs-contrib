## HTTP request

PATCH /security/secureScoreControlProfiles/{id}
```

## Request headers

| Name       | Description|
|:-----------|:-----------|
| Authorization  | Bearer {code}. Required.|
|Prefer | return=representation. |

## Request body

In the request body, supply a JSON representation of the values for relevant fields that should be updated. The body **must** contain the `vendorInformation` property with valid `provider` and `vendor` fields. The following table lists the fields that can be updated for a **secureScoreControlProfile**. The values for existing properties that are not included in the request body will not change. For best performance, don't include existing values that haven't changed.

| Property   | Type |Description|
|:---------------|:--------|:----------|
|assignedTo|String|Name of the analyst the control is assigned to for triage, implementation, or remediation.|
|comment|String|Analyst comments on the control (for customer control management).|
|state| String|Analyst driven setting on the control. Possible values are: `Default`, `Ignored`, `ThirdParty`, `Reviewed`.|
| vendorInformation | [securityVendorInformation](../resources/securityvendorinformation.md) | Complex type containing details about the security product/service vendor, provider, and subprovider (for example, vendor=Microsoft; provider=SecureScore;). **Provider and vendor fields are required.** |


## Response

If successful, this method returns a `204 No Content` response code.

If the optional request header is used, the method returns a `200 OK` response code and the updated [secureScoreControlProfiles](../resources/securescorecontrolprofile.md) object in the response body.
