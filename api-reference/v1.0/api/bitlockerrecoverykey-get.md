# Get bitlockerRecoveryKey
Namespace: microsoft.graph

Retrieve the properties and relationships of a [bitlockerRecoveryKey](../resources/bitlockerrecoverykey.md) object. 

By default, this operation doesn't return the **key** property that represents the actual recovery key. To include the **key** property in the response, use the `$select` OData query parameter. Including the `$select` query parameter triggers a Microsoft Entra audit of the operation and generates an audit log. For more information on audit logs for bitlocker recovery keys, see the KeyManagement category filter of [Microsoft Entra audit logs](/azure/active-directory/reports-monitoring/concept-audit-logs).
