# Remove multiTenantOrganizationMember
Namespace: microsoft.graph

Remove a tenant from a multitenant organization. A tenant can be removed in the following scenarios:

* An active member tenant can remove itself.
* An active owner tenant can remove any other tenant.
* An active owner tenant can remove itself as long as there is another active owner tenant remaining.
* An active owner tenant can remove itself as long as there is no other active tenant remaining, thereby deleting the entire multitenant organization.
