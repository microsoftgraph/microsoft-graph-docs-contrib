In the request body, supply a JSON representation of the modified [shift](../resources/shift.md) object.

The following table lists the properties that you can use when you create a **shift** object.

|Property|Type|Description|
|:---|:---|:---|
| draftShift           | [shiftItem](../resources/shiftitem.md)     | Draft changes in the **shift**. Draft changes are only visible to managers. The changes are visible to employees when they're [shared](../api/schedule-share.md), which copies the changes from the **draftShift** to the **sharedShift** property. Eiher **draShift** or **sharedShift** should be `null`.|
| isStagedForDeletion   | Boolean                           | The **shift** is marked for deletion, a process that is finalized when the schedule is [shared](../api/schedule-share.md). Optional. |
| schedulingGroupId    | String                      | ID of the scheduling group the **shift** is part of. Required. |
| sharedShift          | [shiftItem](../resources/shiftitem.md)     | The shared version of this **shift** that is viewable by both employees and managers. Updates to the **sharedShift** property send notifications to users in the Teams client. Eiher **draShift** or **sharedShift** should be `null`.|
| userId               | String                      | ID of the user assigned to the **shift**. Required. |

## Response
