# Unarchive team

Namespace: microsoft.graph



Restore an archived [team](../resources/team.md). This restores users' ability to send messages and edit the team, abiding by tenant and team settings. Teams are archived using the [archive](team-archive.md) API.

Unarchiving is an async operation. A team is unarchived once the async operation completes successfully, which may occur subsequent to a response from this API.

## Permissions
One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
