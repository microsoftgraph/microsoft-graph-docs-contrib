Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [cloudprinting-pricing-disclaimer](../../includes/cloudprinting-pricing-disclaimer.md)]

Create (register) a printer with the Universal Print service. This is a long-running operation and as such, it returns a [printerCreateOperation](../resources/printercreateoperation.md) that can be used to track and verify the registration of the printer.

For help creating the required Certificate Signing Request (CSR) for creating printer, see the [CSR generation code sample](/universal-print/hardware/universal-print-oem-certificate-signing-request).

## Permissions
One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

In addition to the following permissions, the user's tenant must have an active Universal Print subscription. The signed in user must be a [Printer Administrator](/azure/active-directory/users-groups-roles/directory-assign-admin-roles#printer-administrator).

|Permission type | Permissions (from least to most privileged) |
|:---------------|:--------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account)| Printer.Create, Printer.ReadWrite.All, Printer.FullControl.All |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account)|Not Supported.|

## Response
If successful, this method returns a `202 Accepted` response code and a link to the associated [printerCreateOperation](../resources/printercreateoperation.md) in the `Operation-Location` header.

You make a GET request to the linked URL to get the status of an ongoing printer registration. After printer registration has completed successfully, a GET request to the linked URL will contain the created printer object and registered certificate.
