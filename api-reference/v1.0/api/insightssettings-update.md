### To update itemInsights settings for an organization
<!-- { "blockType": "permissions", "name": "insightssettings_update" } -->
[!INCLUDE [permissions-table](../includes/permissions/insightssettings-update-permissions.md)]

>**Note:** Using delegated permissions for this operation to update item insights requires the signed-in user to have a Global Administrator role.

## HTTP request

To update settings for item insights:
<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->

```http
PATCH /admin/people/itemInsights
```

## Request headers

| Header       | Value|
|:-----------|:------|
|Authorization|Bearer {token}. Required. Learn more about [authentication and authorization](/graph/auth/auth-concepts).|
| Content-Type  | application/json. Required.  |

## Request body

[!INCLUDE [table-intro](../../includes/update-property-table-intro.md)]

| Property | Type | Description |
|:---------------|:--------|:----------|
|disabledForGroup|String| The ID of a Microsoft Entra group, of which the specified type of insights are disabled for its members. Default is `empty`. Optional.|
|isEnabledInOrganization|Boolean| `true` if the specified insight type is enabled for the organization; `false` if the specified insight type is disabled for all users without exceptions. The default value is `true`. Optional.|

>**Note:** This operation doesn't verify the **disabledForGroup** property value if you include it in the request body. If you set the **disabledForGroup** property to a String, this operation doesn't check the existence of the corresponding Microsoft Entra group. This means, if you set **disabledForGroup** to a Microsoft Entra group that doesn't exist or is deleted afterwards, this operation can't identify any group membership and disable item insights for any specific users. If **isEnabledInOrganization** is set to `true`, the operation enables the specified type of insights for _all_ the users in the organization.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and an [insightsSettings](../resources/insightssettings.md) object in the response body.

## Examples

### Request

The following example shows how an admin updates the **disabledForGroup** privacy setting to prevent the display of item insights of users in a particular Microsoft Entra group.
