# Create delegatedPermissionClassification

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Classify a delegated permission by adding a [delegatedPermissionClassification](../resources/delegatedpermissionclassification.md) to the [servicePrincipal](../resources/servicePrincipal.md) representing the API.

[!INCLUDE [national-cloud-support](../../includes/all-clouds.md)]

## Permissions

Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](/graph/permissions-reference).

<!-- { "blockType": "permissions", "name": "serviceprincipal_post_delegatedpermissionclassifications" } -->
[!INCLUDE [permissions-table](../includes/permissions/serviceprincipal-post-delegatedpermissionclassifications-permissions.md)]

## HTTP request

You can address the service principal using either its **id** or **appId**. **id** and **appId** are referred to as the **Object ID** and **Application (Client) ID**, respectively, in app registrations in the Microsoft Entra admin center.

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
POST /servicePrincipals/{id}/delegatedPermissionClassifications
POST /servicePrincipals(appId='{appId}')/delegatedPermissionClassifications
```

## Request headers

| Name       | Description|
|:-----------|:----------|
|Authorization|Bearer {token}. Required. Learn more about [authentication and authorization](/graph/auth/auth-concepts).|
| Content-type | application/json. Required. |

## Request body

In the request body, supply a JSON representation of an [delegatedPermissionClassification](../resources/delegatedpermissionclassification.md) object.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `201 Created` response code and an [delegatedPermissionClassification](../resources/delegatedpermissionclassification.md) object in the response body.

## Examples
