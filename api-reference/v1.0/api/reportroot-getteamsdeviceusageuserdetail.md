Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions).

<!-- { "blockType": "permissions", "name": "reportroot_getteamsdeviceusageuserdetail" } -->
[!INCLUDE [permissions-table](../includes/permissions/reportroot-getteamsdeviceusageuserdetail-permissions.md)]

**Note**: For delegated permissions to allow apps to read service usage reports on behalf of a user, the tenant administrator must have assigned the user the appropriate Microsoft Entra ID limited administrator role. For more information, see [Authorization for APIs to read Microsoft 365 usage reports](/graph/reportroot-authorization).

## HTTP request

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->

```http
GET /reports/getTeamsDeviceUsageUserDetail(period='{period_value}')
GET /reports/getTeamsDeviceUsageUserDetail(date='{date_value}')
```

## Function parameters

In the request URL, provide one of the following parameters with a valid value.

| Parameter | Type   | Description                              |
| :-------- | :----- | :--------------------------------------- |
| period    | string | Specifies the length of time over which the report is aggregated. The supported values for {period_value} are: `D7`, `D30`, `D90`, and `D180`. These values follow the format D*n* where *n* represents the number of days over which the report is aggregated. |
| date      | Date   | Specifies the date for which you would like to view the users who performed any activity. {date_value} must have a format of YYYY-MM-DD. As this report is only available for the past 28 days, {date_value} should be a date from that range. |
