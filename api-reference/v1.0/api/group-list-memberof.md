# List memberOf

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Get groups that the group is a direct member of.

This operation is not transitive. Unlike getting a user's Microsoft 365 groups, this returns all types of groups, not just Microsoft 365 groups.

- `$search` is supported on the **displayName** and **description** properties only.
- The default and maximum page size is 100 and 999 group objects respectively.
- The use of query parameters with this API is supported only with advanced query parameters. For more information, see [Advanced query capabilities on directory objects](/graph/aad-advanced-queries).
