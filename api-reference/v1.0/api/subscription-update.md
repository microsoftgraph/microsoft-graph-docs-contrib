# Update subscription

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Renew a subscription by extending its expiry time.

The table in the [Permissions](#permissions) section lists the resources that support subscribing to change notifications.

Subscriptions expire after a length of time that varies by resource type. In order to avoid missing change notifications, an app should renew its subscriptions well in advance of their expiry date. See [subscription](../resources/subscription.md) for maximum length of a subscription for each resource type.

## Permissions

Depending on the resource and the permission type (delegated or application) requested, the permission specified in the following table is the least privileged required to call this API. To learn more, including [taking caution](/graph/auth/auth-concepts#best-practices-for-requesting-permissions) before choosing more privileged permissions, search for the following permissions in [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

### driveItem

Additional limitations apply for subscriptions on OneDrive items. The limitations apply to creating as well as managing (getting, updating, and deleting) subscriptions.

On personal OneDrive, you can subscribe to the root folder or any subfolder in that drive. On OneDrive for Business, you can subscribe to only the root folder. Change notifications are sent for the requested types of changes on the subscribed folder, or any file, folder, or other **driveItem** instances in its hierarchy. You cannot subscribe to **drive** or **driveItem** instances that are not folders, such as individual files.

### contact, event, and message

You can subscribe to changes in Outlook **contact**, **event**, or **message** resources.
