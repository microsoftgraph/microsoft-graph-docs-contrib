# Add attachment

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Use this API to add an [attachment](../resources/attachment.md) to a message. 

An attachment can be one of the following types:

* A file ([fileAttachment](../resources/fileattachment.md) resource).
* An item (contact, event or message, represented by an [itemAttachment](../resources/itemattachment.md) resource).
* A link to a file ([referenceAttachment](../resources/referenceattachment.md) resource).

All these types of attachment resources are derived from the [attachment](../resources/attachment.md)
resource. 

You can add an attachment to an existing message by posting to its attachments collection, or you can 
add an attachment to a message that is being [created and sent on the fly](../api/user-sendmail.md).

This operation limits the size of the attachment you can add to under 3 MB.
## Permissions
One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
