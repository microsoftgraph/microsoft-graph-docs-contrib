# Add attachment

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Use this API to add an [attachment](../resources/attachment.md) to a message.

An attachment can be one of the following types:

* A file ([fileAttachment](../resources/fileattachment.md) resource).
* An item (contact, event or message, represented by an [itemAttachment](../resources/itemattachment.md) resource).
* A link to a file ([referenceAttachment](../resources/referenceattachment.md) resource).

All these types of attachment resources are derived from the [attachment](../resources/attachment.md)
resource.

You can add an attachment to an existing message by posting to its attachments collection, or you can
add an attachment to a message that is being [created and sent on the fly](../api/user-sendmail.md).

This operation limits the size of the attachment you can add to under 3 MB.

## Permissions
Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](/graph/permissions-reference).

## HTTP request
<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
Attachments for a [message](../resources/message.md) in a user's mailbox.
```http
POST /me/messages/{id}/attachments
POST /users/{id | userPrincipalName}/messages/{id}/attachments
```
Attachments for a [message](../resources/message.md) contained in a top level [mailFolder](../resources/mailfolder.md) in a user's mailbox.
```http
POST /me/mailFolders/{id}/messages/{id}/attachments
POST /users/{id | userPrincipalName}/mailFolders/{id}/messages/{id}/attachments
```
Attachments for a [message](../resources/message.md) contained in a child folder of a [mailFolder](../resources/mailfolder.md) in a user's mailbox.  The
example below shows one level of nesting, but a message can be located in a child of a child and so on.
```http
POST /me/mailFolders/{id}/childFolders/{id}/.../messages/{id}/attachments/{id}
POST /users/{id | userPrincipalName}/mailFolders/{id}/childFolders/{id}/messages/{id}/attachments/{id}
```
