Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types).

[!INCLUDE [permissions-table](../includes/permissions/section-list-pages-permissions.md)]

## HTTP request
<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
GET /me/onenote/sections/{id}/pages
GET /users/{id | userPrincipalName}/onenote/sections/{id}/pages
GET /groups/{id}/onenote/sections/{id}/pages
GET /sites/{id}/onenote/sections/{id}/pages
```
## Optional query parameters
This method supports the [OData Query Parameters](/graph/query-parameters) to help customize the response.

The default query for pages returns the top 20 pages ordered by `lastModifiedTime desc`. If the default query returns more than 20 pages, the response contains an `@odata.nextLink` that you can use to page through the result set. The maximum number of pages returned for a `top` request is 100.

The default response expands `parentSection` and selects the section's `id`, `name`, and `self` properties. Valid `expand` values for pages are `parentNotebook` and `parentSection`.

## Request headers
