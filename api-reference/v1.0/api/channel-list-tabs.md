# List tabs in channel

Namespace: microsoft.graph


Retrieve the list of [tabs](../resources/teamstab.md) in the specified [channel](../resources/channel.md) within a [team](../resources/team.md). 

> **Note**: The Files tab is native to a channel or chat and is not returned by this API.

[!INCLUDE [national-cloud-support](../../includes/global-us.md)]

## Permissions
Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](/graph/permissions-reference).

This API supports admin permissions. Microsoft Teams service admins can access teams that they aren't a member of.

> [!NOTE]
> - The TeamsTab.Read.Group and TeamsTab.ReadWrite.Group permissions use [resource-specific consent](/microsoftteams/platform/graph-api/rsc/resource-specific-consent).
> - The Group.Read.All, Group.ReadWrite.All, Directory.Read.All, and Directory.ReadWrite.All permissions are supported only for backward compatibility. We recommend that you update your solutions to use an alternative permission listed in the previous table and avoid using these permissions going forward.
