# Remove member

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Remove a member from a [group](../resources/group.md) via the **members** navigation property. You can't remove a member from groups with dynamic memberships.

[!INCLUDE [national-cloud-support](../../includes/all-clouds.md)]

## Permissions

Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](/graph/permissions-reference).

<!-- { "blockType": "permissions", "name": "group_delete_members" } -->
[!INCLUDE [permissions-table](../includes/permissions/group-delete-members-permissions.md)]

In delegated scenarios, the signed-in user must also be assigned a supported [Microsoft Entra role](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference?toc=%2Fgraph%2Ftoc.json) or a custom role with the `microsoft.directory/groups/members/update` role permission. The following least privileged roles are supported for this operation, except for role-assignable groups:

- Group owners
- Directory Writers
- Groups Administrator
- Identity Governance Administrator
- User Administrator
- Exchange Administrator - for Microsoft 365 groups only
- SharePoint Administrator - for Microsoft 365 groups only
- Teams Administrator - for Microsoft 365 groups only
- Yammer Administrator - for Microsoft 365 groups only
- Intune Administrator - for security groups only

To remove members from a role-assignable group, the app must also be assigned the *RoleManagement.ReadWrite.Directory* permission and the calling user must be assigned a supported Microsoft Entra role. *Privileged Role Administrator* is the least privileged role that is supported for this operation.

## HTTP request

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->

```http
DELETE /groups/{id}/members/{id}/$ref
```
> [!CAUTION]
> If `/$ref` is not appended to the request and the calling app has permissions to manage the member object type, the member object will also be deleted from Microsoft Entra ID; otherwise, a `403 Forbidden` error is returned. For example, an app with both *GroupMember.ReadWrite.All* and *User.ReadWrite.All* permissions will delete a user. You can restore specific objects through the [Restore deleted items API](directory-deleteditems-restore.md).
