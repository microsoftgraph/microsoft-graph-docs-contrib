# List submission resources

Namespace: microsoft.graph

List the resources associated with a [submission](../resources/educationsubmission.md). Only teachers, students, and applications with application permissions can perform this operation.

The [educationSubmissionResource](../resources/educationsubmissionresource.md) object is a wrapper around the actual resource object the student is working on. The wrapper also includes a pointer to the resources on the assignment if this was copied from the assignment during the assign process. These resources are the working copy of the assignment. The **submittedResources** are the resources that have officially been submitted to be graded.
