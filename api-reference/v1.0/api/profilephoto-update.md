# Update profilephoto

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Update the photo for the signed-in **user**, or the specified **group** or **contact**. Since there
is currently a limit of 4MB on the total size of each REST request, this limits the size of the photo
you can add to under 4MB.

You can use either PATCH or PUT for this operation in version 1.0.

> **Note** This operation in version 1.0 supports only a user's work or school mailboxes and not personal mailboxes.

## Permissions
One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

- Profile photo of the signed-in **user** - User.ReadWrite, User.ReadWrite.All
- Profile photo of a **group** - Group.ReadWrite.All
- Photo of a **contact** - Contacts.ReadWrite

> **Note** To update the photo of any user in the organization, your app must have the User.ReadWrite.All application permission and call this API under its own identity, not on behalf of a user. To learn more, see [get access without a signed-in user](/graph/auth-v2-service).

> **Note:**  There is currently a [known issue](/graph/known-issues#groups) with accessing group photos using application permissions.
