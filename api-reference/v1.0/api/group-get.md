# Get group

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Get the properties and relationships of a [group](../resources/group.md) object.

This operation returns by default only a subset of all the available properties, as noted in the [Properties](../resources/group.md#properties) section. To get properties that aren't_ returned by default, specify them in a `$select` OData query option. The **hasMembersWithLicenseErrors** and **isArchived** properties are an exception and aren't returned in the `$select` query.

> **Note:** This request might have replication delays for groups that were recently created, updated, or deleted.

|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Schema extensions    | Returned only with `$select`.                                                  |
| Open extensions      | Returned through the [Get open extension](opentypeextension-get.md) operation. |
