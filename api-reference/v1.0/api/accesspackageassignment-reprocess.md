# accessPackageAssignment: reprocess

Namespace: microsoft.graph

In [Microsoft Entra entitlement management](../resources/entitlementmanagement-overview.md), callers can automatically reevaluate and enforce an [accessPackageAssignment](../resources/accesspackageassignment.md) object of a userâ€™s assignments for a specific access package. The **state** of the access package assignment must be `Delivered` for the administrator to reprocess the user's assignment. Only admins with the Access Package Assignment Manager role, or higher, in Microsoft Entra entitlement management can perform this action.
