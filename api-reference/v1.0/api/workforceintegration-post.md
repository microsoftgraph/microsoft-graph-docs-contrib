### Request

The following is an example of the request. 
```
POST https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/teamwork/workforceIntegrations/
{
  "displayName": "ABCWorkforceIntegration",
  "apiVersion": 1,
  "isActive": true,
  "encryption": {
    "protocol": "sharedSecret",
    "secret": "My Secret"
  },
  "url": "https://ABCWorkforceIntegration.com/Contoso/",
  "supports": "Shift,SwapRequest",
  "eligibilityFilteringEnabledEntities": "SwapRequest"
}
Authorization: Bearer {token}
Content-type: application/json
```
### Response

The following is an example of the response.
```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
{
  "id": "c5d0c76b-80c4-481c-be50-923cd8d680a1",
  "displayName": "ABCWorkforceIntegration",
  "apiVersion": 1,
  "isActive": true,

  "eligibilityFilteringEnabledEntities": "SwapRequest"
}

```
To see how to update an existing workforceintegration with SwapRequest enabled for eligibility filtering, see [Update](../api/workforceintegration-update.md).

## Example of fetching eligible shifts when SwapRequest is included in eligibilityFilteringEnabledEntities
The interaction between Shifts app and workforce integration endpoints will follow the existing pattern.

### Request

The following is an example of the request made by Shifts to the workforce integration endpoint to fetch eligible shifts for a swap request.

```
POST https://abcWorkforceIntegration.com/Contoso/{apiVersion}/team/{teamId}/read
Accept-Language: en-us
{
  "requests": [
  {
     "id": "{shiftId}",
     "method": "GET”,
     "url": “/shifts/{shiftId}/requestableShifts?requestType={requestType}&startDateTime={startDateTime}&endDateTime={endDateTime}”
   }]
}
```
### Response

The following is an example of the response from the workforce integration service.
```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
{
  "responses": [
  {
    "body": {
      "SHFT_6548f642-cbc1-4228-8621-054327576457",
