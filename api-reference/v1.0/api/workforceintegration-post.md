## HTTP request

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->

```http
POST /teamwork/workforceIntegrations
```

## Request headers

| Name          | Description   |

## Request body

In the request body, supply a JSON representation of the [workforceIntegration](../resources/workforceintegration.md) object.

The following table lists the properties that you can use when you create a **workforceIntegration** object.

| Property     | Type        | Description |
|:-------------|:------------|:------------|
|apiVersion|Int32|API version for the callback URL. Start with 1.|
|displayName|String|Name of the workforce integration.|
|eligibilityFilteringEnabledEntities|eligibilityFilteringEnabledEntities| Support to view eligibility-filtered results. Possible values are: `none`, `swapRequest`, `offerShiftRequest`, `unknownFutureValue`, `timeOffReason`. Use the `Prefer: include-unknown-enum-members` request header to get the following value in this [evolvable enum](/graph/best-practices-concept#handling-future-members-in-evolvable-enumerations): `timeOffReason`.|
|encryption|[workforceIntegrationEncryption](../resources/workforceintegrationencryption.md)|The workforce integration encryption resource.|
|isActive|Boolean|Indicates whether this workforce integration is currently active and available.|
|supportedEntities|workforceIntegrationSupportedEntities | The Shifts entities supported for synchronous change notifications. Shifts call the provided URL when client changes occur to the entities specified in this property. By default, no entities are supported for change notifications. Possible values are: `none`, `shift`, `swapRequest`, `userShiftPreferences`, `openShift`, `openShiftRequest`, `offerShiftRequest`, `unknownFutureValue`, `timeCard`, `timeOffReason`, `timeOff`, `timeOffRequest`. Use the `Prefer: include-unknown-enum-members` request header to get the following values in this [evolvable enum](/graph/best-practices-concept#handling-future-members-in-evolvable-enumerations): `timeCard`, `timeOffReason` , `timeOff` , `timeOffRequest`.|
|url|String| Workforce integration URL used for callbacks from the Shifts service.|

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `201 Created` response code and a new [workforceIntegration](../resources/workforceintegration.md) object in the response body.

```
To see how to update an existing workforceIntegration with SwapRequest enabled for eligibility filtering, see [Update](../api/workforceintegration-update.md).

## Example of fetching eligible shifts when SwapRequest is included in eligibilityFilteringEnabledEntities
The interaction between Shifts app and workforce integration endpoints  follow the existing pattern.

### Request

This example shows a request made by Shifts to the workforce integration endpoint to fetch eligible shifts for a swap request.

```
POST https://abcWorkforceIntegration.com/Contoso/{apiVersion}/team/{teamId}/read
Accept-Language: en-us
{
  "requests": [
  {
     "id": "{shiftId}",
     "method": "GET”,
     "url": “/shifts/{shiftId}/requestableShifts?requestType={requestType}&startDateTime={startDateTime}&endDateTime={endDateTime}”
   }]
}
```
### Response

The following example shows the response from the workforce integration service.
```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
{
  "responses": [
    "id": "{shiftId}",
    "status: 200,
    "body": {
       "data": [{shiftId}, {shiftId}...]
       "error": null
