# List servicePrincipal memberOf

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Get the groups and directory roles that this [servicePrincipal](../resources/serviceprincipal.md) is a direct member of. This operation is not transitive.

## Permissions

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) | Application.Read.All, Application.ReadWrite.All, Directory.Read.All, Directory.ReadWrite.All    |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported.    |
|Application | Application.Read.All, Application.ReadWrite.All, Directory.Read.All, Directory.ReadWrite.All |

[!INCLUDE [limited-info](../../includes/limited-info.md)]

## HTTP request

You can address the service principal using either its **id** or **appId**. **id** and **appId** are referred to as the **Object ID** and **Application (Client) ID**, respectively, in the Azure portal

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
GET /servicePrincipals/{id}/memberOf
GET /servicePrincipals(appId='{appId}')/memberOf
```

## Optional query parameters

This method supports the [OData query parameters](/graph/query-parameters) to help customize the response, including `$search`, `$count`, and `$filter`. OData cast is also enabled, for example, you can cast to get just the directoryRoles the user is a member of. You can use `$search` on the **displayName** and **description** properties. When items are added or updated for this resource, they are specially indexed for use with the `$count` and `$search` query parameters. There can be a slight delay between when an item is added or updated and when it is available in the index.

## Request headers
| Name           | Description                |
|:---------------|:---------------------------|
| Authorization  | Bearer {token}. Required.  |
| ConsistencyLevel | eventual. This header and `$count` are required when using the `$search`, `$filter`, `$orderby`, or OData cast query parameters. It uses an index that might not be up-to-date with recent changes to the object. |

## Request body

Do not supply a request body for this method.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and a collection of [directoryObject](../resources/directoryobject.md) objects in the response body.
