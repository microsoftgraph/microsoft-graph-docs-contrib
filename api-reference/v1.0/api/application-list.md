# List applications

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Get the list of [applications](../resources/application.md) in this organization.

> [!NOTE]
> When calling this API using tokens issued for a personal Microsoft account, it will return the apps owned by the personal Microsoft account. The notion of organizations doesn't exist for personal Microsoft accounts. To list applications owned by a specific personal Microsoft account, this API requires the *User.Read* permission in addition to *Application.Read.All* or *Application.ReadWrite.All*.

[!INCLUDE [national-cloud-support](../../includes/all-clouds.md)]

## Permissions
Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](/graph/permissions-reference).

[!INCLUDE [permissions-table](../includes/permissions/application-list-permissions.md)]

[!INCLUDE [rbac-application-apis-read](../includes/rbac-for-apis/rbac-application-apis-read.md)]

## HTTP request
<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
GET /applications
```
## Optional query parameters

This method supports the `$count`, `$expand`, `$filter`, `$orderby`, `$search`, `$select`, and `$top` [OData query parameters](/graph/query-parameters) to help customize the response. Some relationships also support `$filter`. The default and maximum page sizes are 100 and 999 application objects respectively. Some queries are supported only when you use the **ConsistencyLevel** header set to `eventual` and `$count`. For more information, see [Advanced query capabilities on directory objects](/graph/aad-advanced-queries).

By default, this API doesn't return the value of the **key** in the **keyCredentials** property when listing all applications. To retrieve the public key info in **key**, the **keyCredentials** property must be specified in a `$select` query. For example, `$select=id,appId,keyCredentials`.

The use of `$select` to get **keyCredentials** for applications has a throttling limit of 150 requests per minute for every tenant.

## Request headers

| Name           | Description                |
|:---------------|:---------------------------|
|Authorization|Bearer {token}. Required. Learn more about [authentication and authorization](/graph/auth/auth-concepts).|
| ConsistencyLevel | eventual. This header and `$count` are required when using `$search`, or in specific usage of `$filter`. For more information about the use of **ConsistencyLevel** and `$count`, see [Advanced query capabilities on directory objects](/graph/aad-advanced-queries). |

## Request body
Don't supply a request body for this method.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and a collection of [application](../resources/application.md) objects in the response body.

### Example 2: Get only a count of applications

#### Request

The following example shows a request. This request requires the **ConsistencyLevel** header set to `eventual` because `$count` is in the request. For more information about the use of **ConsistencyLevel** and `$count`, see [Advanced query capabilities on directory objects](/graph/aad-advanced-queries).

>**Note:** The `$count` and `$search` query parameters are currently not available in Azure AD B2C tenants.

### Example 3: Use $filter and $top to get one application with a display name that starts with 'a' including a count of returned objects

#### Request

The following example shows a request. This request requires the **ConsistencyLevel** header set to `eventual` and the `$count=true` query string because the request has both the `$orderby` and `$filter` query parameters. For more information about the use of **ConsistencyLevel** and `$count`, see [Advanced query capabilities on directory objects](/graph/aad-advanced-queries).

>**Note:** The `$count` and `$search` query parameters are currently not available in Azure AD B2C tenants.
