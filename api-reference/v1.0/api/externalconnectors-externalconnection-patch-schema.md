[!INCLUDE [permissions-table](../includes/permissions/externalconnectors-externalconnection-patch-schema-permissions.md)]

## HTTP request

<!-- {
  "blockType": "ignored"
}
-->
```http
PATCH /external/connections/{id}/schema
```

## Request headers

|Name|Description|
|:---|:---|
|Authorization|Bearer {token}. Required. Learn more about [authentication and authorization](/graph/auth/auth-concepts).|
|Content-Type|application/json. Required.|

## Request body

In the request body, supply a JSON representation of a [schema](../resources/externalconnectors-schema.md) object.

When you register a custom item schema, the **schema** object **must** have the **baseType** property set to `microsoft.graph.externalItem` and **must** contain the **properties** property. The **properties** object **must** contain at least one property, up to a maximum of 128.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `202 Accepted` response code and a URL in the `Location` response header that can be used to [get the operation status](../api/externalconnectors-connectionoperation-get.md).

>**Note:** It can take between 5 and 15 minutes for the schema to get created. We recommend that you use the URL in the `Location` response header to get the operation status.
