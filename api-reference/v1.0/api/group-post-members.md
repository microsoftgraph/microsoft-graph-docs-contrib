# Add members

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Add a member to a security or Microsoft 365 [group](../resources/group.md). When using the API to add multiple members in one request, you can add up to only 20 members. 

[!INCLUDE [groups-allowed-member-types](../../../concepts/includes/groups-allowed-member-types.md)]

[!INCLUDE [national-cloud-support](../../includes/all-clouds.md)]

## Permissions

The following table shows the least privileged permission that's required by each resource type when calling this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

| Supported resource                        | Delegated (work or school account)                      | Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Application                                             |
|:------------------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------|:---------------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------|
| [device](../resources/device.md)          | GroupMember.ReadWrite.All and Device.ReadWrite.All      | Not supported.                         | GroupMember.ReadWrite.All and Device.ReadWrite.All      |
| [group](../resources/group.md)            | GroupMember.ReadWrite.All                               | Not supported.                         | GroupMember.ReadWrite.All       |
| [orgContact](../resources/device.md)      | GroupMember.ReadWrite.All and OrgContact.Read.All       | Not supported.                         | GroupMember.ReadWrite.All and OrgContact.Read.All       |
| [servicePrincipal](../resources/group.md) | GroupMember.ReadWrite.All and Application.ReadWrite.All | Not supported.                         | GroupMember.ReadWrite.All and Application.ReadWrite.All |
| [user](../resources/user.md)              | GroupMember.ReadWrite.All                               | Not supported.                         | GroupMember.ReadWrite.All                               |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In delegated scenarios, the signed-in user must also be assigned a supported [Microsoft Entra role](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference?toc=%2Fgraph%2Ftoc.json) or a custom role with the `microsoft.directory/groups/members/update` role permission. The following roles are the least privileged roles that are supported for this operation, except for role-assignable groups:
> 
> - Group owners
> - Directory Writers
> - Groups Administrator
> - Identity Governance Administrator
> - User Administrator
> - Exchange Administrator - only for Microsoft 365 groups
> - SharePoint Administrator - only for Microsoft 365 groups
> - Teams Administrator - only for Microsoft 365 groups
> - Yammer Administrator - only for Microsoft 365 groups
> - Intune Administrator - only for security groups
> 
> To add members to a role-assignable group, the app must also be assigned the *RoleManagement.ReadWrite.Directory* permission and the calling user must be assigned a supported Microsoft Entra role. *Privileged Role Administrator* is the least privileged role that is supported for this operation.

## HTTP request

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->

```http
POST /groups/{group-id}/members/$ref
PATCH /groups/{group-id}/members
```

## Request headers

| Header        | Value                       |
| :------------ | :-------------------------- |
|Authorization|Bearer {token}. Required. Learn more about [authentication and authorization](/graph/auth/auth-concepts).|
| Content-type  | application/json. Required. |

## Request body

When using the `POST /groups/{group-id}/members/$ref` syntax, supply a JSON object that contains an **@odata.id** property with a reference by ID to a supported group member object type.

When using the `PATCH /groups/{group-id}/members` syntax, supply a JSON object that contains a **members@odata.bind** property with one or more references by IDs to a supported group member object type. That is:
- For Microsoft 365 groups, only `https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/directoryObjects/{id}` and `https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/groups/{id}` is allowed where `{id}` must be a user because only users can members of Microsoft 365 groups.
- For security groups, the following ID references are allowed:
  - `https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/directoryObjects/{id}` where `{id}` must belong to a user, security group, device, service principal, or organizational contact.
  - `https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/groups/{id}` where `{id}` must belong to another security group. Microsoft 365 groups can't be members of security groups.
  - `https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/devices/{id}` where `{id}` belongs to a device.
  - `https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/servicePrincipal/{id}` where `{id}` belongs to a service principal.
  - `https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/orgContact/{id}` where `{id}` belongs to an organizational contact.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `204 No Content` response code. It returns a `400 Bad Request` response code when the object is already a member of the group or is unsupported as a group member. It returns a `404 Not Found` response code when the object being added doesn't exist. It returns `403 Unauthorized` in one of the following scenarios:
- You're attempting to add a member to a [group that can't be managed through Microsoft Graph](../resources/groups-overview.md#types-of-groups-supported-in-microsoft-graph). This API supports only security and Microsoft 365 groups.
- You're attempting to add a member you don't have permissions to add. Refer to the preceding [Permissions](#permissions) section for the permissions required to add different member types.
- You're attempting to add a member to a role-assignable group and you don't have the required permissions.

### Example 2: Add multiple members to a group in a single request

This example shows how to add multiple members to a group with OData bind support in a PATCH operation. Up to 20 members can be added in a single request. If an error condition exists in the request body, no members are added and the appropriate response code is returned.

#### Request

The following example shows a request.

# [HTTP](#tab/http)

<!-- {
  "blockType": "request",
  "name": "add_multiple_members_to_group"
}-->

```http
PATCH https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/groups/{group-id}
Content-type: application/json

{
  "members@odata.bind": [
    "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/directoryObjects/{id}",
