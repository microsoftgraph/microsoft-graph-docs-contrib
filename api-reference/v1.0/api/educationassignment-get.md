# Get educationAssignment

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Get the properties and relationships of an [assignment](../resources/educationassignment.md). Only teachers, students, and applications with application permissions can perform this operation.

Students can only see assignments assigned to them; teachers and applications with application permissions can see all assignments in a class.

You can use the `Prefer` header in your request to get the `inactive` status in case the assignment is deactivated; otherwise, the response value for the **status** property is `unknownFutureValue`.

[!INCLUDE [national-cloud-support](../../includes/global-only.md)]

## Permissions
Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](/graph/permissions-reference).
