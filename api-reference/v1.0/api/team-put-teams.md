# Create team from group

Namespace: microsoft.graph



Create a new [team](../resources/team.md) under a [group](../resources/group.md).

In order to create a team, the group must have a least one owner.

If the group was created less than 15 minutes ago, it's possible for the Create team call to fail with a 404 error code due to replication delays. 
The recommended pattern is to retry the Create team call three times, with a 10 second delay between calls.
