# directoryObject: checkMemberGroups

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Check for membership in a specified list of group IDs, and return from that list those groups (identified by IDs) of which the specified [user](../resources/user.md), [group](../resources/group.md), [service principal](../resources/serviceprincipal.md), [organizational contact](../resources/orgcontact.md), [device](../resources/device.md), or [directory object](../resources/directoryobject.md) is a member. This function is transitive.

You can check up to a maximum of 20 groups per request. This function supports all groups provisioned in Azure AD. Because Microsoft 365 groups cannot contain other groups, membership in a Microsoft 365 group is always direct.

<!--

Use the follow scenario guidance to help determine which permission types to use:

| Scenario | Permissions to use |
|:-|:-|
| To get group memberships for the signed-in user | Use one of the following sets of permissions: <br/> <li> **User.Read** and **GroupMember.Read.All** <li>**User.Read** and **Group.Read.All** |
| To get group memberships for any user | Use one of the following sets of permissions: <br/> <li> **User.ReadBasic.All** and **GroupMember.Read.All** <li>**User.Read.All** and **GroupMember.Read.All** <li>**User.ReadBasic.All** and **Group.Read.All** <li>**User.Read.All** and **Group.Read.All** |
| To get group memberships for a group | Use either the **GroupMember.Read.All** or **Group.Read.All** permission. |
| To get group memberships for a directory object | Use the **Directory.Read.All** permission. |

<!-- These tables will replace the data in lines 22-36 to help with the tooling that parses permissions tables.
+ Current data is copy-pasted from incorrect files/file names
