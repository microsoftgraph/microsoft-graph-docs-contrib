# Delete remoteDesktopSecurityConfiguration
Namespace: microsoft.graph

Delete a [remoteDesktopSecurityConfiguration](../resources/remotedesktopsecurityconfiguration.md) object on a servicePrincipal. Removing remoteDesktopSecurityConfiguration object on the servicePrincipal disables the Microsoft Entra ID [Remote Desktop Services (RDS) authentication protocol](/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-rdpbcgr/dc43f040-d75d-49a9-90c6-0c9999281136) to authenticate a user to [Microsoft Entra joined](/azure/active-directory/devices/concept-directory-join) or [Microsoft Entra hybrid joined](/azure/active-directory/devices/concept-hybrid-join) devices, and removes any target device groups that you configured for SSO.
