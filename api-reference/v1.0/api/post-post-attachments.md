# Add attachment

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Add an [attachment](../resources/attachment.md) when creating a group post.

This operation limits the size of the attachment you can add to under 3 MB.

An attachment can be one of the following types:

* A file ([fileAttachment](../resources/fileattachment.md) resource).
* An item (contact, event or message, represented by an [itemAttachment](../resources/itemattachment.md) resource).
* A link to a file ([referenceAttachment](../resources/referenceattachment.md) resource).

All these types of attachment resources are derived from the [attachment](../resources/attachment.md)
resource.
