# servicePrincipal: addKey

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Adds a key credential to a [servicePrincipal](../resources/serviceprincipal.md). This method along with [removeKey](serviceprincipal-removekey.md) can be used by a servicePrincipal to automate rolling its expiring keys.

> [!NOTE]
> [Create servicePrincipal](../api/serviceprincipal-post-serviceprincipals.md) and
[Update servicePrincipal](../api/serviceprincipal-update.md) operations can continue to be used to add and update key credentials for any servicePrincipal with or without a user's context.

As part of the request validation for this method, a proof of possession of an existing key is verified before the action can be performed. 

ServicePrincipals that don't have any existing valid certificates (i.e.: no certificates have been added yet, or all certificates have expired), won't be able to use this service action. [Update servicePrincipal](../api/serviceprincipal-update.md) can be used to perform an update instead.

Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](/graph/permissions-reference).

## HTTP request

You can address the service principal using either its **id** or **appId**. **id** and **appId** are referred to as the **Object ID** and **Application (Client) ID**, respectively, in app registrations in the Microsoft Entra admin center.

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->

```http
POST /serviceprincipals/{id}/addKey
POST /servicePrincipals(appId='{appId}')/addKey
```

## Request headers

| Name           | Description                |
|:---------------|:---------------------------|
|Authorization|Bearer {token}. Required. Learn more about [authentication and authorization](/graph/auth/auth-concepts).|
| Content-Type   | application/json. Required.|

## Request body

In the request body, provide the following required properties.

| Property       | Type    |Description|
|:---------------|:--------|:----------|
| keyCredential | [keyCredential](../resources/keycredential.md) | The new servicePrincipal key credential to add. The __type__, __usage__ and __key__ are required properties for this usage. Supported key types are:<br><ul><li>`AsymmetricX509Cert`: The usage must be `Verify`.</li><li>`X509CertAndPassword`: The usage must be `Sign`</li></ul>|
| passwordCredential | [passwordCredential](../resources/passwordcredential.md) | Only __secretText__ is required to be set which should contain the password for the key. This property is required only for keys of type `X509CertAndPassword`. Set it to `null` otherwise.|
| proof | String | A self-signed JWT token used as a proof of possession of the existing keys. This JWT token must be signed with a private key that corresponds to one of the existing valid certificates associated with the **servicePrincipal**. The token should contain the following claims:<ul><li>**aud**: Audience needs to be `00000002-0000-0000-c000-000000000000`.</li><li>**iss**: Issuer needs to be the ID of the **servicePrincipal** that initiates the request.</li><li>**nbf**: Not before time.</li><li>**exp**: Expiration time should be the value of **nbf** + 10 minutes.</li></ul><br>For steps to generate this proof of possession token, see [Generating proof of possession tokens for rolling keys](/graph/application-rollkey-prooftoken).|


## Response

If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and a new [keyCredential](../resources/keycredential.md) object in the response body.
