[!INCLUDE [permissions-table](../includes/permissions/serviceprincipal-list-owners-permissions.md)]

[!INCLUDE [limited-info](../../includes/limited-info.md)]

> [!IMPORTANT]
> 
> In delegated scenarios with work or school accounts, the signed-in user must be assigned a supported [Microsoft Entra role](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference?toc=%2Fgraph%2Ftoc.json) or a custom role with a supported role permission. The following least privileged roles are supported for this operation.
> - A non-admin member or guest user with default user permissions
> - Application Developer - for the application they own
> - Directory Readers
> - Global Secure Access Administrator
> - Global Reader
> - Hybrid Identity Administrator
> - Cloud Application Administrator
> - Application Administrator
