## HTTP request

To update String data types, such as signInPageText and usernameHintText, use the PATCH method. To update Stream data types, such as backgroundLogo and backgroundImage, use the PUT method. You can't update Stream types with other data types in the same request.

<!-- {
  "blockType": "ignored"
}
-->
``` http
PATCH /organization/{organizationId}/branding/localizations/{organizationalBrandingLocalizationId}

PUT /organization/{organizationId}/branding/localizations/{organizationalBrandingLocalizationId}/{Stream object type such as backgroundImage}
```

## Request headers
|Name|Description|
|:---|:---|
|Authorization|Bearer {token}. Required. Learn more about [authentication and authorization](/graph/auth/auth-concepts).|
|Content-Type|application/json. Required.|

## Request body
In the request body, supply *only* the values for properties that should be updated. Existing properties that are not included in the request body will maintain their previous values or be recalculated based on changes to other property values.

The following table specifies the properties that can be updated. 

| Property     | Type        | Description |
|:-------------|:------------|:------------|
| backgroundColor | String | Color that will appear in place of the background image in low-bandwidth connections. We recommend that you use the primary color of your banner logo or your organization color. Specify this in hexadecimal format, for example, white is `#FFFFFF`. |
| backgroundImage | Stream | Image that appears as the background of the sign-in page. The allowed types are PNG or JPEG not smaller than 300 KB and not larger than 1920 × 1080 pixels. A smaller image will reduce bandwidth requirements and make the page load faster. |
| bannerLogo | Stream | A banner version of your company logo that appears on the sign-in page. The allowed types are PNG or JPEG no larger than 36 × 245 pixels. We recommend using a transparent image with no padding around the logo. |
| signInPageText | String | Text that appears at the bottom of the sign-in box. You can use this to communicate additional information, such as the phone number to your help desk or a legal statement. This text must be Unicode and not exceed 1024 characters. |
| squareLogo | Stream | A square version of your company logo that appears in Windows 10 out-of-box experiences (OOBE) and when Windows Autopilot is enabled for deployment. Allowed types are PNG or JPEG no larger than 240 x 240 pixels and no more than 10 KB in size. We recommend using a transparent image with no padding around the logo.|
| usernameHintText | String | String that shows as the hint in the username textbox on the sign-in screen. This text must be a Unicode, without links or code, and can't exceed 64 characters.|

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `204 No Content` response code.
