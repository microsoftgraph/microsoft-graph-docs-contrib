## HTTP request

<!-- {
  "blockType": "ignored"
}
-->
``` http
DELETE /admin/edge/internetExplorerMode/siteLists/{browserSiteListId}/sharedCookies/{browserSharedCookieId}
```

## Request headers
|Name|Description|
|:---|:---|
|Authorization|Bearer {token}. Required. Learn more about [authentication and authorization](/graph/auth/auth-concepts).|

## Request body
Don't supply a request body for this method.

## Response

If the shared cookie was not previously published, then this method returns a `204 No Content` response code on a successful delete. If the shared cookie was previously published, then this method returns a `200 OK` response code and a [browserSiteList](../resources/browsersitelist.md) object in the response body with the status as `pendingDelete`. You must publish (for example, via the [browserSiteList: publish](../api/browsersitelist-publish.md) API) the shared cookie to fully remove it from the site list.
