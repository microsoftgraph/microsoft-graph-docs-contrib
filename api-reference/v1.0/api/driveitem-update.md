# Update DriveItem properties

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Update the metadata for a [driveItem](../resources/driveitem.md) by ID or [path](/graph/onedrive-addressing-driveitems#path-based-addressing).

You can also use update to [move an item](driveitem-move.md) to another parent by updating the item's **parentReference** property.
