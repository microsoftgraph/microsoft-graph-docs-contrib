# List Windows settings

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Get a list of [windowsSetting](../resources/windowssetting.md) objects and their properties for the signed in user.

[!INCLUDE [national-cloud-support](../../includes/global-only.md)]

## Permissions

Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](/graph/permissions-reference).

<!-- { "blockType": "permissions", "name": "usersettings_list_windows" } -->
[!INCLUDE [permissions-table](../includes/permissions/usersettings-list-windows-permissions.md)]

## HTTP request

<!-- {
  "blockType": "ignored"
}
-->
``` http
GET /me/settings/windows
````

## Optional query parameters

This method supports the `$filter` OData query parameter to help customize the response. For general information, see [OData query parameters](/graph/query-parameters).

You can filter the results by the following properties:

- **windowsDeviceId**: A string value that represents the unique identifier of a Windows device. This identifier can be found in the response body. When you filter on **windowsDeviceId**, you can get a list of settings specific to that device. Only the equality (`eq`) comparison is supported for this parameter.
- **settingType**: An enumeration with the following valid values: `roaming` and `backup`. The **settingType** property allows you to narrow down the results to settings related to either roaming or backup. Only the equality (`eq`) comparison is supported for this parameter. For more information, see [windowsSettingType](../resources/enums.md#windowssettingtype-values).

For more details about how to use this query parameter, see the [Examples](./usersettings-list-windows.md#examples) section.

## Request headers

| Name          | Description                                                                                               |
| :------------ | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Authorization | Bearer {token}. Required. Learn more about [authentication and authorization](/graph/auth/auth-concepts). |
| Prefer        |Optional. This API supports the *odata.maxpagesize* parameter through this header for pagination purposes. The minimum and maximum valid values for *odata.maxpagesize* are **1** and **200** respectively. If no value is passed, the default value is **110**.|

## Request body

Don't supply a request body for this method.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and a collection of [windowsSetting](../resources/windowssetting.md) objects in the response body.

If the response contains more than one page of data, the response body will contain an `@odata.nextLink` property. This property will contain a URL that can be used to request the next page of data. The URL should be used without any modification.
