### driveItem

Additional limitations apply for subscriptions on OneDrive items. The limitations apply to creating as well as managing (getting, updating, and deleting) subscriptions.

On a personal OneDrive, you can subscribe to the root folder or any subfolder in that drive. On OneDrive for Business, you can subscribe to only the root folder. Change notifications are sent for the requested types of changes on the subscribed folder, or any file, folder, or other **driveItem** instances in its hierarchy. You can't subscribe to **drive** or **driveItem** instances that aren't folders, such as individual files.

### contact, event, and message

You can subscribe to changes in Outlook **contact**, **event**, or **message** resources.

[!INCLUDE [outlook-subscription-notes](../../includes/outlook-subscription-notes.md)]
 
### presence

Subscriptions on **presence** require [encryption](/graph/webhooks-with-resource-data) for notifications that include resource data. The subscription creation fails if [encryptionCertificate](../resources/subscription.md) and [encryptionCertificateId](../resources/subscription.md) aren't specified when notifications need to include resource data. For details about presence subscriptions, see [Get change notifications for presence updates in Microsoft Teams](/graph/changenotifications-for-presence).

### virtualEventWebinar

Subscriptions on virtual events support only basic notifications and are limited to a few entities of a virtual event. For more information about the supported subscription types, see [Get change notifications for Microsoft Teams virtual event updates](/graph/changenotifications-for-virtualevent).
