# Assign appliesTo

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Assign an [appManagementPolicy](../resources/appManagementPolicy.md) policy object to an application or service principal object. The application or service principal adopts this policy over the tenant-wide [tenantAppManagementPolicy](../resources/tenantappmanagementpolicy.md) setting. Only one policy object can be assigned to an application or service principal.
