# Remove deleted fileStorageContainer

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Permanently remove a [fileStorageContainer](../resources/filestoragecontainer.md) from the deleted container collection. Removing a file storage container with this API permanently removes it from the deleted container collection. Therefore, it can't be restored later.
