# Grant an appRoleAssignment to a service principal

Namespace: microsoft.graph


Assign an app role to a client service principal.

App roles that are assigned to service principals are also known as [application permissions](/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-permissions-and-consent#permission-types). Application permissions can be granted directly with app role assignments, or through a [consent experience](/azure/active-directory/develop/application-consent-experience).

To grant an app role assignment to a client service principal, you need three identifiers:

- `principalId`: The `id` of the client service principal to which you are assigning the app role.
- `resourceId`: The `id` of the resource `servicePrincipal` (the API) which has defined the app role (the application permission).
- `appRoleId`: The `id` of the `appRole` (defined on the resource service principal) to assign to the client service principal.

## Permissions

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) | AppRoleAssignment.ReadWrite.All, Directory.ReadWrite.All, Directory.AccessAsUser.All    |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported.    |
|Application | AppRoleAssignment.ReadWrite.All, Directory.ReadWrite.All |

## HTTP request

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
POST /servicePrincipals/{id}/appRoleAssignments
```

> [!NOTE]
> As a best practice, we recommend creating app role assignments through the [`appRoleAssignedTo` relationship of the _resource_ service principal](serviceprincipal-post-approleassignedto.md), instead of the `appRoleAssignments` relationship of the assigned user, group, or service principal.

## Request headers

| Name       | Description|
|:-----------|:----------|
| Authorization | Bearer {token}. Required.  |
| Content-type | application/json. Required. |

## Request body

In the request body, supply a JSON representation of an [appRoleAssignment](../resources/approleassignment.md) object.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `201 Created` response code and an [appRoleAssignment](../resources/approleassignment.md) object in the response body.

## Examples

### Request

In this example, note that the value used as the service principal **id** in the request URL (`9028d19c-26a9-4809-8e3f-20ff73e2d75e`) is the same as the **principalId** property in the body. The **resourceId** value is the **id** of the resource service principal (the API).
