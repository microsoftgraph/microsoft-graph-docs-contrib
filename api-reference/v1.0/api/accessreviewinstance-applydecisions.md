# accessReviewInstance: applyDecisions
Namespace: microsoft.graph

Apply review decisions on an [accessReviewInstance](../resources/accessreviewinstance.md) if the decisions were not applied automatically because the autoApplyDecisionsEnabled property is `false` in the review's [accessReviewScheduleSettings](../resources/accessreviewschedulesettings.md).


The status of the accessReviewInstance must be `Completed` to call this method.
