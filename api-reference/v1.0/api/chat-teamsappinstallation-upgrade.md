# teamsAppInstallation in chat: upgrade

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Upgrade an [app installation](../resources/teamsappinstallation.md) within a [chat](../resources/chat.md).

> **Notes**:
> - If the chat is associated with an [onlineMeeting](../resources/onlinemeeting.md) instance, then effectively, the **teamsApp** installed in the meeting gets upgraded.

[!INCLUDE [national-cloud-support](../../includes/all-clouds.md)]

## Permissions

Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](/graph/permissions-reference).

> **Note:** The TeamsAppInstallation.ReadWriteSelfForChat, TeamsAppInstallation.ReadWriteForChat, TeamsAppInstallation.ReadWriteSelfForChat.All, and TeamsAppInstallation.ReadWriteForChat.All permissions can't be used to install apps that require consent to resource-specific permissions.
