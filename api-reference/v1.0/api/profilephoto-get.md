# Get profilePhoto

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Get the specified [profilePhoto](../resources/profilephoto.md) or its metadata (**profilePhoto** properties).

The supported sizes of HD photos on Microsoft 365 are as follows: 48x48, 64x64, 96x96, 120x120, 240x240,
360x360, 432x432, 504x504, and 648x648. Photos can be any dimension if they're stored in Microsoft Entra ID.

You can get the metadata of the largest available photo or specify a size to get the metadata for that photo size.
If the size you request is unavailable, you can still get a smaller size that the user has uploaded and made available.
For example, if the user uploads a photo that is 504x504 pixels, all but the 648x648 size of the photo is available for download.

#### Response

Contains the binary data of the requested photo. The HTTP response code is 200.

<!-- {
  "blockType": "response"
}-->

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
```

#### Using the binary data of the requested photo

When you use the `/photo/$value` endpoint to get the binary data for a profile photo, you need to convert the data into a base-64 string to add it as an email attachment. The following JavaScript example shows how to create an array that you can pass as the value of the `Attachments` parameter of an [Outlook message](user-post-messages.md).

```java
const attachments = [{
  '@odata.type': '#microsoft.graph.fileAttachment',
  ContentBytes: file.toString('base64'),
  Name: 'mypic.jpg'
}];
```

For implementation details, see the [Microsoft Graph Connect Sample for Node.js](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/nodejs-connect-rest-sample).

If you want to display the image on a web page, create an in-memory object from the image and make that object the source of an image element. The following JavaScript example shows this operation.

```javascript
const url = window.URL || window.webkitURL;
const blobUrl = url.createObjectURL(image.data);
document.getElementById(imageElement).setAttribute("src", blobUrl);
```
