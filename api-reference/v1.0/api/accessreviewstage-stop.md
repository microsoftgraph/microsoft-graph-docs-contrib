# accessReviewStage: stop
Namespace: microsoft.graph

Stop an [access review stage](../resources/accessReviewStage.md) that is `inProgress`. After the access review stage stops, the stage **status** will be `Completed` and the reviewers can no longer give input. If there are subsequent stages that depend on the completed stage, the next stage will be created. 

The [accessReviewInstanceDecisionItem](../resources/accessreviewinstancedecisionitem.md) objects will always reflect the last decisions recorded across all stages at that given time, regardless of the status of the stages.
