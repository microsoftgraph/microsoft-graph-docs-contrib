# Create chat
Namespace: microsoft.graph

Create a new [chat](../resources/chat.md) object.

> **Note:** Only one one-on-one chat can exist between two members. If a one-on-one chat already exists, this operation returns the existing chat and doesn't create a new one.

[!INCLUDE [national-cloud-support](../../includes/all-clouds.md)]
