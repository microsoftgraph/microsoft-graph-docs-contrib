# contentType: addCopyFromContentTypeHub
Namespace: microsoft.graph

Add or sync a copy of a published content type from the content type hub to a target [site](../resources/site.md) or a [list](../resources/list.md).

This method is part of the content type publishing changes to optimize the syncing of published content types to sites and lists, effectively switching from a "push everywhere" to "pull as needed" approach. The method allows users to pull content types directly from the content type hub to a site or list. For more information, see [contentType: getCompatibleHubContentTypes](contenttype-getcompatiblehubcontenttypes.md) and the blog post [Syntex Product Updates â€“ August 2021](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/sharepoint-syntex-blog/syntex-product-updates-august-2021/ba-p/2606438).

## HTTP request

<!-- {
  "blockType": "ignored"
}
-->
``` http
POST /sites/{siteId}/lists/{listId}/contentTypes/addCopyFromContentTypeHub
POST /sites/{siteId}/contentTypes/addCopyFromContentTypeHub
```

## Request headers
|Name|Description|
|:---|:---|
|Authorization|Bearer {token}. Required. Learn more about [authentication and authorization](/graph/auth/auth-concepts).|
|Content-Type|application/json. Required.|

## Request body
In the request body, supply a JSON representation of the parameters.

The following table shows the parameter that can be used with this action.

|Parameter|Type|Description|
|:---|:---|:---|
|contentTypeId|String| The ID of the content type in the content type hub that will be added to a target site or a list.|



## Response

If successful, this action returns a `200 OK` response code and a [contentType](../resources/contenttype.md) object in the response body if the content type is added synchronously or a `202 Accepted` response code if the content type will be synced asynchronously. The response will also contain a `Location` header, which contains the location of the [richLongRunningOperation](../resources/richlongrunningoperation.md) that was created to handle the copy/sync operation. In case of an asynchronous operation, it can take up to 70 minutes to sync or add a content type.

## Examples

### Example 1: Synchronous pull

The following example adds or syncs a content type synchronously based on certain backend conditions.

#### Request

The following is an example of a synchronous operation.

### Example 2: Asynchronous pull

The following example adds or syncs a content type asynchronously because the backend conditions for a synchronous operation are not fulfilled.

#### Request

The following is an example of an asynchronous operation.
