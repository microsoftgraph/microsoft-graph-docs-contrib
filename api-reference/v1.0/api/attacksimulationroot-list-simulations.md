# List simulations
Namespace: microsoft.graph

Get a list of attack simulation campaigns for a tenant.

## Permissions
One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

| Permission type                        | Permissions (from least to most privileged) |
|:---------------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------|
| Delegated (work or school account)     | AttackSimulation.Read.All                   |
| Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported.                              |
| Application                            | AttackSimulation.Read.All                   |

## HTTP request

<!-- {
  "blockType": "ignored"
}
-->
``` http
GET /security/attackSimulation/simulations
```

## Optional query parameters

This method supports the `$count`, `$filter`, `$orderby`, `$skipToken`, `$top`, and `$select` [OData query parameters](/graph/query-parameters) to help customize the response. You can use the `$filter` and `$orderby` query parameters on the **attackTechnique**, **attackType**, **completionDateTime**, **displayName**, **isAutomated**, **launchDateTime**, and **status** properties.

If the result set spans multiple pages, the response body contains an `@odata.nextLink` that you can use to page through the result set.

The following are examples of their use:

<!-- {
  "blockType": "ignored"
}
-->
``` http
GET /security/attackSimulation/simulations?$count=true
GET /security/attackSimulation/simulations?$filter={property} eq '{property-value}'
GET /security/attackSimulation/simulations?$filter={property} eq '{property-value}'&$top=5
GET /security/attackSimulation/simulations?$orderby={property}
GET /security/attackSimulation/simulations?$skipToken={skipToken}
GET /security/attackSimulation/simulations?$top=1
GET /security/attackSimulation/simulations?$select={property}
```

## Request headers
|Name|Description|
|:---|:---|
|Authorization|Bearer {token}. Required.|

## Request body
Do not supply a request body for this method.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and a collection of [simulation](../resources/simulation.md) objects in the response body.
