# event: permanentDelete

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Permanently delete an event and place it in the **purges** folder in the dumpster in the user's mailbox. Email clients such as outlook or outlook on the web can't access permanently deleted items. Unless there's a hold set on the mailbox, the items are permanently deleted after a set period of time.

For more information about item retention, see [Configure deleted item retention and recoverable items quotas](/exchange/configure-deleted-item-retention-and-recoverable-items-quotas-exchange-2013-help).
