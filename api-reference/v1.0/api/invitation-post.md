# Create invitation

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Use this API to create a new [invitation](../resources/invitation.md) or reset the redemption status for a guest user who already redeemed their invitation. The invitation adds the external user to the organization as part of B2B collaboration. B2B collaboration is supported in both Microsoft Entra External ID in workforce and external tenants.

When creating a new invitation, you have several options available:

1. On invitation creation, Microsoft Graph can automatically send an invitation email directly to the invited user, or your app can use the **inviteRedeemUrl** returned in the response to craft your own invitation (through your communication mechanism of choice) to the invited user. If you decide to have Microsoft Graph send an invitation email automatically, you can specify the content and language of the email by using [invitedUserMessageInfo](../resources/invitedusermessageinfo.md).
2. When the user is invited, a user entity (of **userType** `Guest`) is created and can be used to control access to resources. The invited user has to go through the redemption process to access any resources they have been invited to.

## Permissions

Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](/graph/permissions-reference).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> 
> In delegated scenarios with work or school accounts, the signed-in user must be assigned a supported [Microsoft Entra role](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference?toc=%2Fgraph%2Ftoc.json) or a custom role with a supported role permission. The following least privileged roles are supported for this operation:
> - To invite guests: 
>   - Both nonadmin member users and guest users can invite guests if the tenant admin hasn't restricted the [default user permissions](/entra/fundamentals/users-default-permissions?toc=%2Fgraph%2Ftoc.json).
>   - Guest Inviter, Directory Writers, or User Administrator.
> - To reset the redemption status: Helpdesk Administrator or User Administrator.
> - Application permissions (app-only) don't work if B2B invitations are disabled on the tenant.
> - When resetting the redemption status for a guest user, the *User.ReadWrite.All* permission is the least privileged permission for the operation.
