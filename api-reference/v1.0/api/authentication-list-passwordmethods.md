# List passwordMethods

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Retrieve a list of the passwords registered to a user, represented by a [passwordAuthenticationMethod](../resources/passwordauthenticationmethod.md) object. This will return exactly one object, as a user can have exactly one password. For security, the password itself will never be returned in the object and the **password** property is always `null`.
