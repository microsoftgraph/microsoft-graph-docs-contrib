# Create accessPackageResourceRequest

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Create a new [accessPackageResourceRequest](../resources/accesspackageresourcerequest.md) object to request the addition of a resource to an access package catalog, update of a resource, or the removal of a resource from a catalog.  A resource must be included in an access package catalog before a [role of that resource](../resources/accesspackageresourcerole.md) can be added to an access package.

- To add a Microsoft Entra group as a resource to a catalog, set the **requestType** to be `adminAdd`, and a `resource` representing the resource. The value of the **originSystem** property within the `resource` should be `AadGroup` and the value of the **originId** is the identifier of the group.
- To add a Microsoft Entra application as a resource to a catalog, set the **requestType** to be `adminAdd`, and a `resource` representing the resource. The value of the **originSystem** property within the `resource` should be `AadApplication` and the value of the **originId** is the identifier of the [servicePrincipal](../resources/serviceprincipal.md).
- To add a SharePoint Online site as a resource to a catalog, set the **requestType** to be `adminAdd`, and a `resource` representing the resource. The value of the **originSystem** property within the `resource` should be `SharePointOnline` and the value of the **originId** is the URI of the site.
- To remove a resource from a catalog, set the **requestType** to be `adminRemove`, and the `resource` to contain the `id` of the [resource](../resources/accesspackageresource.md) object to be removed.  The resource object can be retrieved using [list resources](accesspackagecatalog-list-resources.md).

## Permissions

Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](/graph/permissions-reference).

> [!TIP]
> In delegated scenarios with work or school accounts, the signed-in user must also be assigned an administrator role with supported role permissions through one of the following options:
> 
> - A [role in the Entitlement Management system](/entra/id-governance/entitlement-management-delegate) where the least privileged role is *Catalog owner*. **This is the least privileged option**.
> - More privileged [Microsoft Entra roles](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference?toc=%2Fgraph%2Ftoc.json) supported for this operation:
>     - Identity Governance Administrator
> 
> In app-only scenarios, the calling app can be assigned one of the preceding supported roles instead of the `EntitlementManagement.ReadWrite.All` application permission. The *Catalog owner* role is less privileged than the `EntitlementManagement.ReadWrite.All` application permission.
> 
> Additionally you must also have the following permissions on the resource being added:
>   - To add a Microsoft Entra group as a resource to a catalog:
>       - If using delegated permissions, the user requesting to add a group should be an owner of the group or in a directory role that allows them to modify groups.
>       - If using application permissions, the application requesting to add the group should also be assigned the `Group.ReadWrite.All` permission.
>   - To add a Microsoft Entra role as a resource to a catalog:
>       - If using delegated permissions, the user who wants to add the role to the catalog needs to be a Global Administrator or a Privileged Role Administrator with Catalog Owner permissions.
>       - Applications with the Entitlement Management.ReadWrite.All permissions cannot add Microsoft Entra roles to catalogs unless they also have Global Administrator or Privilege Role Administrator permissions.
>   - To add a Microsoft Entra application as a resource to a catalog:
>       - If using delegated permissions, the user requesting to add an application should be an owner of the application or in a directory role that allows them to modify application role assignments.
>       - If using application permissions, the application requesting to add the [servicePrincipal](../resources/serviceprincipal.md) should also be assigned the *Application.ReadWrite.All* permission.
>   - To add a SharePoint Online site as a resource to a catalog:
>       - If using delegated permissions, the user must be assigned the *SharePoint Administrator* role or be an administrator of the SharePoint site.
>       - If using application permissions, the application should also be assigned the `Sites.FullControl.All` permission.
> For more information, see [Delegation and roles in entitlement management](/entra/id-governance/entitlement-management-delegate) and [how to delegate access governance to access package managers in entitlement management](/entra/id-governance/entitlement-management-delegate-managers).



## HTTP request

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->

```http
POST /identityGovernance/entitlementManagement/resourceRequests
```

## Request headers

| Name          | Description   |
|:--------------|:--------------|
|Authorization|Bearer {token}. Required. Learn more about [authentication and authorization](/graph/auth/auth-concepts).|
| Content-Type  | application/json. Required.  |

## Request body

In the request body, supply a JSON representation of an [accessPackageResourceRequest](../resources/accesspackageresourcerequest.md) object. Include the `resource` relationship with an [accessPackageResource](../resources/accesspackageresource.md) object as part of the request, and a `catalog` object containing its `id`.

If successful, this method returns a `201 Created` response code and a new [accessPackageResourceRequest](../resources/accesspackageresourcerequest.md) object in the response body.
