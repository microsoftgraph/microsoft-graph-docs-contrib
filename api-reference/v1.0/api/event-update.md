# Update event

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Update the properties of the [event](../resources/event.md) object.

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD001 -->

[!INCLUDE [national-cloud-support](../../includes/all-clouds.md)]

### Notes for updating specific properties

Note the following behaviors or recommendations when updating the corresponding properties:

- **attendees** property and meeting updates
  - An event update that includes only the **attendees** property in the request body sends a meeting update to only the attendees that have changed.
  - An event update that removes an attendee specified as a member of a distribution list sends a meeting update to all the attendees.

- **body** property and online meetings

  Before updating the body of an event that has been set up as an online meeting, be sure to first get the **body** property, apply the appropriate changes to the content, and preserve the meeting blob for online meeting. Inadvertently removing the meeting blob from the body would disable meeting online.

- **end** and **start** properties and their time zones

  When updating the time zone of the start or end time of an event, first [find the supported time zones](outlookuser-supportedtimezones.md) to make sure you set only time zones that have been configured for the user's mailbox server.

Because the **event** resource supports [extensions](/graph/extensibility-overview), you can use the `PATCH` operation to
add, update, or delete your own app-specific data in custom properties of an extension in an existing **event** instance.

If the **event** you're updating is the master event of a recurring series, contains multiple attendees, and has instances that have been updated separately, multiple notification emails will be sent out: one for the master series and one per instance that has been updated.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and updated [event](../resources/event.md) object in the response body.

>**Note:** This method can return an HTTP 400 Bad Request response with an error code of `ErrorOccurrenceCrossingBoundary` and the following error message: Modified occurrence is crossing or overlapping adjacent occurrence. This indicates that the update violates the following Outlook restriction on recurrence exceptions: an occurrence cannot be moved to or before the day of the previous occurrence, and cannot be moved to or after the day of the following occurrence.
