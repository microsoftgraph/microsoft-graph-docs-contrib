# Delete schedulingGroup

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Mark a [schedulingGroup](../resources/schedulinggroup.md) as inactive by setting its **isActive** property.
This method does not remove the [schedulingGroup](../resources/schedulinggroup.md) from the schedule. Existing [shift](../resources/shift.md) instances assigned to the scheduling group remain part of the group.
