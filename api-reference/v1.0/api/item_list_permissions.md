# List permissions

Retrieve a list of permission objects. The permissions collection includes potentially sensitive information and may not be available for every caller.

* For the owner of the item all permissions will be returned. This includes co-owners.
* For a non-owner caller only the permissions that apply to the caller are returned.
* Permission properties containing secrets (e.g. link.token and link.webUrl) are only returned for callers that are able to create the Permission:
  * For application permissions, that is only the app that matches the link.identity of the permission.
  * For other permissions, only first party applications will have access.

### Prerequisites
One of the following **scopes** is required to execute this API:

  * Files.Read

### HTTP request
<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
GET /drive/root/permissions
GET /drive/items/<id>/permissions
GET /drives/<id>/root/permissions
```

### Request headers
| Name       | Type | Description|
|:---------------|:--------|:----------|
| if-none-match  | string  | If this request header is included and the etag provided matches the current etag on the item, an `HTTP 304 Not Modified` response is returned.|
| Authorization  | string  | Bearer <token>. Required. |

### Optional query parameters
This method supports the [OData Query Parameters](http://graph.microsoft.io/docs/overview/query_parameters) to help customize the response.
### Request body
Do not supply a request body for this method.
### Response
If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and collection of [permission](../resources/permission.md) objects in the response body.

Effective permissions of an item can come from two sources: either permissions set directly on the item itself or that are inherited from the item's ancestors.

Callers can differentiate if the permission is inherited or not by checking the inheritedFrom property. This property is an itemReference resource referencing the ancestor that the permission is inherited from.
