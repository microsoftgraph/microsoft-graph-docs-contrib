# virtualEventTownhall: cancel
Namespace: microsoft.graph

Cancel a [virtualEventTownhall](../resources/virtualeventtownhall.md). A canceled town hall has its **status** set to `canceled` permanently. You can still get a canceled town hall by using the [Get virtualEventTownhall](../api/virtualeventtownhall-get.md) API.

Only the **Organizer** can cancel a townhall event.
