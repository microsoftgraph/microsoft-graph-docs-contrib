# List members

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Get a list of the group's direct members. A group can have users, organizational contacts, devices, service principals and other groups as members. Currently service principals are not listed as group members due to staged roll-out of service principals on Graph V1.0 endpoint. This operation is not transitive.

When a group contains more than 100 members, Microsoft Graph returns a `@odata.nextLink` property in the response that contains a URL to the next page of results. If that property is present, continue making additional requests with the `@odata.nextLink` URL in each response, until all the results are returned, as described in [paging Microsoft Graph data in your app](/graph/paging).

## Permissions
One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) | GroupMember.Read.All, Group.Read.All, GroupMember.ReadWrite.All, Group.ReadWrite.All, Directory.Read.All  |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported.    |
|Application | GroupMember.Read.All, Group.Read.All, GroupMember.ReadWrite.All, Group.ReadWrite.All, Directory.Read.All |

## HTTP request
<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
GET /groups/{id}/members
```

## Optional query parameters

This method supports the [OData query parameters](/graph/query-parameters) to help customize the response, including `$search`, `$count`, and `$filter`. OData cast is also enabled, for example, you can cast to get just the users that are a member of the group. You can use `$search` on the **displayName** and **description** properties. When items are added or updated for this resource, they are specially indexed for use with the `$count` and `$search` query parameters. There can be a slight delay between when an item is added or updated and when it is available in the index.

## Request headers

| Header       | Value |
|:-----------|:----------|
| Authorization  | Bearer {token}. Required. |
| ConsistencyLevel | eventual. This header and `$count` are required when using the `$search`, `$filter`, `$orderby`, or OData cast query parameters. It uses an index that might not be up-to-date with recent changes to the object. |

## Request body
Do not supply a request body for this method.

## Response
If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and a collection of [directoryObject](../resources/directoryobject.md) objects in the response body.
