# educationSubmission: excuse

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Excuse a [submission](../resources/educationsubmission.md). Excused submissions aren't included in average grade calculations. Grading rubrics and feedback are deleted. Only teachers can perform this action. 

If the `Prefer: include-unknown-enum-members` request header is provided, the excused submission shows the **excused** status. Otherwise, the submission status retains the **returned** status. For more information about how to use this header, see the [Examples](#examples) section.

[!INCLUDE [national-cloud-support](../../includes/global-only.md)]
