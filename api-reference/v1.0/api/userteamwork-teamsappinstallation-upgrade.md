# teamsAppInstallation in personal scope: upgrade

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Upgrade an [app installation](../resources/teamsappinstallation.md) in the personal scope of the specified [user](../resources/user.md) to the latest version of the app.

>**Note:** This API works differently in one or more national clouds. For details, see [Microsoft Teams API implementation differences in national clouds](/graph/teamwork-national-cloud-differences).

## Permissions

Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](/graph/permissions-reference).
