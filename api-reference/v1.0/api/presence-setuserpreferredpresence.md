# presence: setUserPreferredPresence

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Set the preferred availability and activity status for a user. If the preferred presence of a user is set, the user's presence shows as the preferred status.

Preferred presence takes effect only when at least one [presence session](presence-setpresence.md#presence-sessions) exists for the user. Otherwise, the user's presence shows as `Offline`.

A presence session is created as a result of a successful [setPresence](presence-setpresence.md) operation, or if the user is signed in on a Microsoft Teams client.

For more details, see [presence sessions](presence-setpresence.md#presence-sessions) and [time-out and expiration](presence-setpresence.md#timeout-expiration-and-keep-alive).
