# List assignmentRequests

Namespace: microsoft.graph

In [Microsoft Entra entitlement management](../resources/entitlementmanagement-overview.md), retrieve a list of [accessPackageAssignmentRequest](../resources/accesspackageassignmentrequest.md) objects.  The resulting list includes all the assignment requests, current and well as expired, that the caller has access to read, across all catalogs and access packages.

Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](/graph/permissions-reference).

## HTTP request

<!-- {
  "blockType": "ignored"
}
-->
``` http
GET /identityGovernance/entitlementManagement/assignmentRequests
```

## Query parameters

This method supports the `$select`, `$expand` and `$filter` OData query parameters to help customize the response.  Not all attributes of an [accessPackageAssignmentRequest](../resources/accesspackageassignmentrequest.md) are supported for filtering.

If the user or application only has permissions within a specific catalog or catalogs, you must include in the query a filter which specifies an access package, such as `$expand=accessPackage&$filter=accessPackage/id eq '9bbe5f7d-f1e7-4eb1-a586-38cdf6f8b1ea'`.

### Example scenarios for using query parameters

- To retrieve requests created after a specific date, include `$filter=createdDateTime gt 2022-04-01T00:00:01Z` in the query.
- To retrieve the access package of each request, include `$expand=accessPackage` in the query.
- To retrieve the resulting assignment, include `$expand=assignment` in the query.
- To obtain more details on the requestor, include `$expand=requestor` in the query.

For general information, see [OData query parameters](/graph/query-parameters).

## Request headers

| Name      |Description|
