# callRecord: getDirectRoutingCalls

Namespace: microsoft.graph.callRecords

Get a log of direct routing calls as a collection of [directRoutingLogRow](../resources/callrecords-directroutinglogrow.md) entries.

[!INCLUDE [national-cloud-support](../../includes/global-us.md)]

## Permissions

Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](/graph/permissions-reference).

<!-- { "blockType": "permissions", "name": "callrecords_callrecord_getdirectroutingcalls" } -->
[!INCLUDE [permissions-table](../includes/permissions/callrecords-callrecord-getdirectroutingcalls-permissions.md)]

## HTTP request

<!-- {
  "blockType": "ignored"
}
-->

``` http
GET /communications/callRecords/getDirectRoutingCalls(fromDateTime={fromDateTime},toDateTime={toDateTime})
```

## Request headers

|Name|Description|
|:---|:---|
|Authorization|Bearer {token}. Required. Learn more about [authentication and authorization](/graph/auth/auth-concepts).|

## Function parameters

In the request URL, provide the following query parameters with values.
The following table shows the parameters that can be used with this function.

|Parameter|Type|Description|
|:---|:---|:---|
|fromDateTime|DateTimeOffset|Start of time range to query. UTC, inclusive.<br/>Time range is based on the call start time.|
|toDateTime|DateTimeOffset|End of time range to query. UTC, exclusive.|

## Response

If successful, this function returns a `200 OK` response code and a collection of [directRoutingLogRow](../resources/callrecords-directroutinglogrow.md) entries in the response body.

If there are more than 1,000 entries in the date range, the body also includes an `@odata.nextLink` with a URL to query the next page of call entries. The last page in the date range doesn't have `@odata.nextLink`. For more information, see [paging Microsoft Graph data in your app](/graph/paging).

## Example

The following example shows getting a collection of records for direct routing calls that occurred in the specified date range. The response includes `"@odata.count": 1000` to enumerate the number of records in this first response, and `@odata.nextLink` to get records beyond the first 1,000. For readability, the response shows only a collection of one record. Assume there are more than 1,000 calls in that date range.
