# Update user

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Update the properties of a [user](../resources/user.md) object. Not all properties can be updated by Member or Guest users with their default permissions without Administrator roles. [Compare member and guest default permissions](/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/users-default-permissions#compare-member-and-guest-default-permissions) to see properties they can manage.

## Permissions
One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) | User.ReadWrite, User.ReadWrite.All, User.ManageIdentities.All, Directory.ReadWrite.All, Directory.AccessAsUser.All    |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | User.ReadWrite    |
|Application | User.ReadWrite.All, User.ManageIdentities.All, Directory.ReadWrite.All |

>[!NOTE]
> - When updating the **passwordProfile** property, the following permission is required: Directory.AccessAsUser.All.
> - Updating another user's **businessPhones**, **mobilePhone**, or **otherMails** property is only allowed on users who are non-administrators or assigned one of the following roles: Directory Readers, Guest Inviter, Message Center Reader, and Reports Reader. For more details, see Helpdesk (Password) Administrator in [Azure AD built-in roles](/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference).  This is the case for apps granted either the User.ReadWrite.All or Directory.ReadWrite.All delegated or application permissions.
> - Your personal Microsoft account must be tied to an AAD tenant to update your profile with the User.ReadWrite delegated permission on a personal Microsoft account.
> - Updating the **identities** property requires the User.ManageIdentities.All permission. Also, adding a [B2C local account](../resources/objectidentity.md) to an existing **user** object is not allowed, unless the **user** object already contains a local account identity.
