# List submissions

Namespace: microsoft.graph

List all the submissions associated with an [assignment](../resources/educationassignment.md). Only teachers, students, and applications with application permissions can perform this operation.

A teacher or an application with application permissions can get all the submissions while a student can only get submissions that they're associated with.

[!INCLUDE [national-cloud-support](../../includes/global-only.md)]

## Permissions

Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](/graph/permissions-reference).
