## HTTP request

<!-- {
  "blockType": "ignored"
}
-->

```http
GET /education/classes
```

## Optional query parameters

You can use the OData query option `$orderby` to sort groups in an organization by the **displayName** values, as shown in the following example:

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->

```http
GET https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/groups?$orderby=displayName
```

You can also use the `$filter`, `$count` and `$search` query parameters to limit the response. 

When items are added or updated for this resource, they are specially indexed for use with the `$count` and `$search` query parameters. There can be a slight delay between when an item is added or updated and when it is available in the index.

For more information on OData query options, see [OData query parameters](/graph/query-parameters).
