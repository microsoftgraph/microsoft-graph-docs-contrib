# Add attribute (to user flow)
Namespace: microsoft.graph

Add an attribute to an external identities self-service sign up user flow that's represented by an [externalUsersSelfServiceSignupEventsFlow](../resources/externalusersselfservicesignupeventsflow.md) object. You can add both custom and built-in attributes to a user flow.

The attribute is added to both the **attributeCollection**> **attributes** and **attributeCollection**> **attributeCollectionPage** > **views** collections on the user flow. In the **views** collection, the attribute is assigned the default settings. You can [PATCH the user flow](../api/authenticationeventsflow-update.md) to customize the settings of the attribute on the **views** object, for example, marking it as required or updating the allowed input types.
