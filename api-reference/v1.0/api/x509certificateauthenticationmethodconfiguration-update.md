## HTTP request
<!-- {
  "blockType": "ignored"
}
-->
``` http
PATCH /policies/authenticationMethodsPolicy/authenticationMethodConfigurations/x509Certificate
```

## Request headers
|Name|Description|
|:---|:---|
|Authorization|Bearer {token}. Required. Learn more about [authentication and authorization](/graph/auth/auth-concepts).|
|Content-Type|application/json. Required.|

## Request body
The following properties can be updated.

|Property|Type|Description|
|:---|:---|:---|
|state|authenticationMethodState|The possible values are: `enabled`, `disabled`. Inherited from [authenticationMethodConfiguration](../resources/authenticationmethodconfiguration.md).|
|certificateUserBindings|[x509CertificateUserBinding](../resources/x509certificateuserbinding.md) collection|Defines fields in the X.509 certificate that map to attributes of the Microsoft Entra user object in order to bind the certificate to the user. The **priority** of the object determines the order in which the binding is carried out. The first binding that matches will be used and the rest ignored. |
|authenticationModeConfiguration|[x509CertificateAuthenticationModeConfiguration](../resources/x509certificateauthenticationmodeconfiguration.md)|Defines strong authentication configurations. This configuration includes the default authentication mode and the different rules for strong authentication bindings. |
|crlValidationConfiguration|[x509CertificateCRLValidationConfiguration](../resources/x509certificatecrlvalidationconfiguration.md)|Determines whether certificate based authentication should fail if the issuing CA doesn't have a valid certificate revocation list configured. |

>**Note:** The `@odata.type` property with a value of `#microsoft.graph.x509CertificateAuthenticationMethodConfiguration` must be included in the body.


## Response
If successful, this method returns a `204 No Content` response code. It doesn't return anything in the response body.
