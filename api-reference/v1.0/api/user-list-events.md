# List events

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Get a list of [event](../resources/event.md) objects in the user's mailbox. The list contains single
instance meetings and series masters.

To get expanded event instances, you can [get the calendar view](calendar-list-calendarview.md), or
[get the instances of an event](event-list-instances.md).

Currently, this operation returns event bodies in only HTML format.

There are two scenarios where an app can get events in another user's calendar:

* If the app has application permissions, or,
* If the app has the appropriate delegated [permissions](#permissions) from one user, and another user has shared a calendar with that user, or, has given delegated access to that user. See [details and an example](/graph/outlook-get-shared-events-calendars).

[!INCLUDE [national-cloud-support](../../includes/all-clouds.md)]

### Support various time zones

For all GET operations that return events, you can use the `Prefer: outlook.timezone` header to specify the time zone for the event start and end times in the response.

For example, the following `Prefer: outlook.timezone` header sets the start and end times in the response to Eastern Standard Time.
```http
Prefer: outlook.timezone="Eastern Standard Time"
```

If the event was created in a different time zone, the start and end times will be adjusted to the time zone specified in that `Prefer` header.
See this [list](../resources/datetimetimezone.md) for the supported time zone names. If the `Prefer: outlook.timezone` header is not specified, the start and end
times are returned in UTC.

You can use the **OriginalStartTimeZone** and **OriginalEndTimeZone** properties on the **event** resource to
find out the time zone used when the event was created.

## Permissions
One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) | Calendars.ReadBasic, Calendars.Read, Calendars.ReadWrite    |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Calendars.ReadBasic, Calendars.Read, Calendars.ReadWrite    |

## HTTP request
<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
GET /me/events
GET /users/{id | userPrincipalName}/events

GET /me/calendar/events
GET /users/{id | userPrincipalName}/calendar/events

GET /me/calendars/{id}/events
GET /users/{id | userPrincipalName}/calendars/{id}/events

GET /me/calendarGroups/{id}/calendars/{id}/events
GET /users/{id | userPrincipalName}/calendarGroups/{id}/calendars/{id}/events

## Optional query parameters
This method supports the [OData query parameters](/graph/query-parameters) to help customize the response.

> [!NOTE]
> You can't use the `$filter` parameter to filter on the **recurrence** property.

## Request headers
| Name       | Type | Description |
|:---------------|:--------|:--------|
| Authorization  | string |Bearer {token}. Required. Learn more about [authentication and authorization](/graph/auth/auth-concepts).|
| Prefer: outlook.timezone  | string | Use this to specify the time zone for start and end times in the response. If not specified, those time values are returned in UTC. Optional. |
| Prefer: outlook.body-content-type | string | The format of the **body** property to be returned in. Values can be "text" or "html". A `Preference-Applied` header is returned as confirmation if this `Prefer` header is specified. If the header is not specified, the **body** property is returned in HTML format. Optional. |

## Request body
Don't supply a request body for this method.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and collection of [event](../resources/event.md) objects in the response body.
## Examples
### Request
The following example shows a request. It specifies the following:

- A `Prefer: outlook.timezone` header to get date time values returned in Pacific Standard Time.
- A `$select` query parameter to return specific properties. Without a `$select` parameter, all of the event properties will be returned.
