# user: assignLicense

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Add or remove licenses for the user to enable or disable their use of Microsoft cloud offerings that the company has licenses to. For example, an organization can have a Microsoft 365 Enterprise E3 subscription with 100 licenses, and this request assigns one of those licenses to a specific user. You can also enable and disable specific plans associated with a subscription. Direct user licensing method is an alternative to [group-based licensing](../api/group-assignlicense.md).
