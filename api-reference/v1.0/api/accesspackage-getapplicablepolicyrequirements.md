# accessPackage: getApplicablePolicyRequirements
Namespace: microsoft.graph


In [Microsoft Entra entitlement management](../resources/entitlementmanagement-overview.md), this action retrieves a list of [accessPackageAssignmentRequestRequirements](../resources/accesspackageassignmentrequestrequirements.md) objects that the currently signed-in user can use to create an [accessPackageAssignmentRequest](../resources/accesspackageassignmentrequest.md).  Each requirement object corresponds to an access package assignment policy that the currently signed-in user is allowed to request an assignment for.

## Request body
Don't supply a request body for this method.

## Response
If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and an [accessPackageAssignmentRequestRequirements](../resources/accesspackageassignmentrequestrequirements.md) collection in the response body, one object for each policy for which the user is an **allowedRequestor**. If there is a policy with no requirements, the **accessPackageAssignmentRequestRequirements** will have `false` and `null` values. If there are no policies where the user is an **allowedRequestor**, an empty collection will be returned instead.
