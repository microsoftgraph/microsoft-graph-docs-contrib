# Create subscription

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Subscribes a listener application to receive change notifications when the requested type of changes occur to the specified resource in Microsoft Graph.

## Permissions

 Creating a subscription requires read scope to the resource. For example, to get change notifications on messages, your app needs the `Mail.Read` permission. 
 
 Depending on the resource and the permission type (delegated or application) requested, the permission specified in the following table is the least privileged required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

| Supported resource | Delegated (work or school account) | Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Application |
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|[callRecord](../resources/callrecords-callrecord.md) (/communications/callRecords) | Not supported | Not supported | CallRecords.Read.All  |
|[contact](../resources/contact.md) | Contacts.Read | Contacts.Read | Contacts.Read |
|[driveItem](../resources/driveitem.md) (user's personal OneDrive) | Not supported | Files.ReadWrite | Not supported |
|[driveItem](../resources/driveitem.md) (OneDrive for Business) | Files.ReadWrite.All | Not supported | Files.ReadWrite.All |
|[event](../resources/event.md) | Calendars.Read | Calendars.Read | Calendars.Read |
|[group](../resources/group.md) | Group.Read.All | Not supported | Group.Read.All |
|[group conversation](../resources/conversation.md) | Group.Read.All | Not supported | Not supported |
|[list](../resources/list.md) | Sites.ReadWrite.All | Not supported | Sites.ReadWrite.All |
|[message](../resources/message.md) | Mail.ReadBasic, Mail.Read | Mail.ReadBasic, Mail.Read | Mail.ReadBasic, Mail.Read |
|[security alert](../resources/alert.md) | SecurityEvents.ReadWrite.All | Not supported | SecurityEvents.ReadWrite.All |
|[user](../resources/user.md) | User.Read.All | User.Read.All | User.Read.All |

> **Note:** There are additional limitations for subscriptions on OneDrive and Outlook items. The limitations apply to creating as well as managing subscriptions (getting, updating, and deleting subscriptions).

- On personal OneDrive, you can subscribe to the root folder or any subfolder in that drive. On OneDrive for Business, you can subscribe to only the root folder. Change notifications are sent for the requested types of changes on the subscribed folder, or any file, folder, or other **driveItem** instances in its hierarchy. You cannot subscribe to **drive** or **driveItem** instances that are not folders, such as individual files.

- In Outlook, delegated permission supports subscribing to items in folders in only the signed-in user's mailbox. That means, for example, you cannot use the delegated permission Calendars.Read to subscribe to events in another user's mailbox.
- To subscribe to change notifications of Outlook contacts, events, or messages in _shared or delegated_ folders:

  - Use the corresponding application permission to subscribe to changes of items in a folder or mailbox of _any_ user in the tenant.
  - Do not use the Outlook sharing permissions (Contacts.Read.Shared, Calendars.Read.Shared, Mail.Read.Shared, and their read/write counterparts), as they do **not** support subscribing to change notifications on items in shared or delegated folders.

##### Response

Here is an example of the response. Note: The response object shown here may be truncated for brevity. All of the properties will be returned from an actual call.
<!-- {
  "blockType": "response",
  "truncated": true,
  "@odata.type": "microsoft.graph.subscription"
} -->

}
```

## Notification endpoint validation

The subscription notification endpoint (specified in the `notificationUrl` property) must be capable of responding to a validation request as described in [Set up notifications for changes in user data](/graph/webhooks#notification-endpoint-validation). If validation fails, the request to create the subscription returns a 400 Bad Request error.
