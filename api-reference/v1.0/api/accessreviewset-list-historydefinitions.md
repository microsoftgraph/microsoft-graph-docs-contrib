Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions).

## HTTP request

## Optional query parameters

This method supports the `$top`, `$filter`, `$expand`, and `$skip` OData query parameters to help customize the response. For general information, see [OData query parameters](/graph/query-parameters). Including `?$expand=instances` will return the [accessReviewHistoryDefinitions](../resources/accessreviewhistorydefinition.md) objects along with their associated instances.

The default page size for this API is 100 **accessReviewHistoryDefinitions** objects. To improve efficiency and avoid timeouts due to large result sets, apply pagination using the `$skip` and `$top` query parameters. For more information, see [Paging Microsoft Graph data in your app](/graph/paging).
