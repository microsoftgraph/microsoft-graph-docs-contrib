# Create learningCourseActivity

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Create a new [learningCourseActivity](../resources/learningcourseactivity.md) object.

A learning course activity can be one of two types: 
- [Assignment](../resources/learningassignment.md)
- [Self-initiated](../resources/learningselfinitiatedcourse.md)

Use this method to create either type of activity.

>**Note**: Learning course activities can be managed by a provider only when **isCourseAcitvitySyncEnabled** is set to `true`.  To update the value, use the [Update learningProvider](../api/learningprovider-update.md) method.

## Permissions

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

| Permission type                        | Permissions (from least to most privileged)                                     |
