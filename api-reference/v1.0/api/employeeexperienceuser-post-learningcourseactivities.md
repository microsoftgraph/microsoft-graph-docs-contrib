# Create learningCourseActivity

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Create a new [learningCourseActivity](../resources/learningcourseactivity.md) object.

A learning course activity can be one of two types: 
- [Assignment](../resources/learningassignment.md)
- [Self-initiated](../resources/learningselfinitiatedcourse.md)

Use this method to create either type of activity.

>**Note**: A provider can only manage learning course activities when **isCourseAcitvitySyncEnabled** is set to `true`.  To update the value, use the [Update learningProvider](../api/learningprovider-update.md) method.

[!INCLUDE [national-cloud-support](../../includes/global-only.md)]
