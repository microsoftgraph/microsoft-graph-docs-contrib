# Add owners

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Add a user or service principal to a Microsoft 365 or security [group's](../resources/group.md) owners. The owners are a set of users or service principals who are allowed to modify the group object.

> **Important:** If you update the group owners and you created a team for the group, it can take up to 2 hours for the owners to be synchronized with Microsoft Teams. Also, if you want the owner to be able to make changes in a team - for example, by creating a Planner plan - the owner also needs to be added as a group/team member.

## Permissions

Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](/graph/permissions-reference).

<!-- { "blockType": "permissions", "name": "group_post_owners" } -->
[!INCLUDE [permissions-table](../includes/permissions/group-post-owners-permissions.md)]

In delegated scenarios, the signed-in user must also be assigned a supported [Microsoft Entra role](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference?toc=%2Fgraph%2Ftoc.json) or a custom role with the required role permission. The following least privileged roles are supported for this operation:

| Microsoft Entra role | Limitations | Key role permission |

| Group owners | Can modify all types of group owners | microsoft.directory/groups/owners/update |
| User Administrator | Can modify user owners only | microsoft.directory/groups/owners/update |
