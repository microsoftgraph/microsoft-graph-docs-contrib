# List childFolders

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Get the folder collection under the specified folder. You can use the `.../me/mailFolders` shortcut to get the top-level
folder collection and navigate to another folder.

By default, this operation does not return hidden folders. Use a query parameter _includeHiddenFolders_ to include them in the response.

## HTTP request

To get all the child folders under the specified folder, excluding those that are hidden:
<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->

```http

GET /users/{id | userPrincipalName}/mailFolders/{id}/childFolders?includeHiddenFolders=true
```

## Optional query parameters
