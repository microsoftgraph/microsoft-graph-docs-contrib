# Update application

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Update the properties of an [application](../resources/application.md) object.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Using PATCH to set [**passwordCredential**](../resources/passwordcredential.md) is not supported. Use the [addPassword](./application-addpassword.md) and [removePassword](./application-removepassword.md) methods to update the password for an application.

## Permissions
One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).


|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) |  Application.ReadWrite.All, Directory.AccessAsUser.All    |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Application.ReadWrite.All |
|Application | Application.ReadWrite.OwnedBy, Application.ReadWrite.All |

## HTTP request
<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
PATCH /applications/{id}
```
## Request headers
| Name       | Description|
|:-----------|:----------|
| Authorization | Bearer {token}. Required.  |
| Content-Type | application/json. Required. |

## Request body
In the request body, supply the values for relevant fields that should be updated. Existing properties that are not included in the request body will maintain their previous values or be recalculated based on changes to other property values. For best performance, don't include existing values that haven't changed.

When configured, Azure AD encrypts all the tokens it emits by using the key this property points to. The application code that receives the encrypted token must use the matching private key to decrypt the token before it can be used for the signed-in user.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
