# Get printJob
Namespace: microsoft.graph

Retrieve the properties and relationships of a print job.

[!INCLUDE [national-cloud-support](../../includes/global-us.md)]

## Permissions
Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](/graph/permissions-reference).

> **Note:** For an app with delegated permissions to cancel other users' jobs, the signed-in user must be a member of the Printer Administrator role.

For an app with application permissions to retrieve users' jobs, the app needs a permission that grants [Get printer](printer-get.md) access along with one of the application permissions described in the [Permissions](#permissions) table.
