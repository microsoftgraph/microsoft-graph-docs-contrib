# Get printJob
Namespace: microsoft.graph

Retrieve the properties and relationships of a print job.

## Permissions
One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

In addition to the following permissions, the user or app's tenant must have an active Universal Print subscription.

|Permission type | Permissions (from least to most privileged) |
|:---------------|:--------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account)| PrintJob.ReadBasic, PrintJob.Read, PrintJob.ReadBasic.All, PrintJob.Read.All, PrintJob.ReadWriteBasic, PrintJob.ReadWrite, PrintJob.ReadWriteBasic.All, PrintJob.ReadWrite.All |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account)|Not supported.|
|Application| PrintJob.ReadBasic.All, PrintJob.Read.All, PrintJob.ReadWriteBasic.All, PrintJob.ReadWrite.All |

For an app with delegated permissions to retrieve other users' jobs, the signed-in user must be a member of one of the following administrator roles:
- Global Administrator
- Printer Administrator

For an app with application permissions to retrieve users' jobs, the app needs a permission that grants [Get printer](printer-get.md) access along with one of the application permissions described in the [Permissions](#permissions) table.
