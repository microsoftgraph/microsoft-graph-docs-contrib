# Restore deleted item (directory object)

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Restore a recently deleted [application](../resources/application.md), [group](../resources/group.md), [servicePrincipal](../resources/serviceprincipal.md), [administrative unit](../resources/administrativeunit.md), or [user](../resources/user.md) object from [deleted items](../resources/directory.md). 

Restore a recently deleted directory object from [deleted items](../resources/directory.md). The following types are supported:
- [administrativeUnit](../resources/administrativeunit.md)
- [application](../resources/application.md)
- [certificateBasedAuthPki](../resources/certificatebasedauthpki.md)
- [certificateAuthorityDetail](../resources/certificateauthoritydetail.md)
- [group](../resources/group.md)
- [servicePrincipal](../resources/serviceprincipal.md)
- [user](../resources/user.md)
- 
If an item was accidentally deleted, you can fully restore the item. However, security groups can't be restored. Also, restoring an application doesn't restore the associated service principal automatically. You must call this API to explicitly restore the deleted service principal.

A recently deleted item remains available for up to 30 days. After 30 days, the item is permanently deleted.
