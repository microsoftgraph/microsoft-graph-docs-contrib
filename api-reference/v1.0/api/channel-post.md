# Create channel

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Create a new [channel](../resources/channel.md) in a team, as specified in the request body.  When you create a channel, the maximum length of the channel's `displayName` is 50 characters. This is the name that appears to the user in Microsoft Teams.

If you're creating a private channel, you can add a maximum of 200 members.

> [!NOTE]
> Some special characters in the channel name will cause the [Get filesFolder](/graph/api/channel-get-filesfolder) API to return an error. For details, see [Known issues](/graph/known-issues#create-channel).

## Permissions

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) | Channel.Create, Group.ReadWrite.All**, Directory.ReadWrite.All** |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported.    |
|Application | Channel.Create.Group*, Channel.Create, Teamwork.Migrate.All, Group.ReadWrite.All**, Directory.ReadWrite.All** |

> **Notes**: 
> Permissions marked with ** are supported only for backward compatibility. We recommend that you update your solutions to use an alternative permission listed in the previous table and avoid using these permissions going forward. Permissions marked with * use [resource-specific consent](/microsoftteams/platform/graph-api/rsc/resource-specific-consent).
>
> This API supports admin permissions. Global admins and Microsoft Teams service admins can access teams that they are not a member of.
>
> In the future, Microsoft may require you or your customers to pay additional fees based on the amount of data imported
using Teamwork.Migrate.All and/or [migration APIs](/microsoftteams/platform/graph-api/import-messages/import-external-messages-to-teams).
