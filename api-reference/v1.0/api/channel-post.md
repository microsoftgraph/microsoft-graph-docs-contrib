# Create channel

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Create a new [channel](../resources/channel.md) in a team, as specified in the request body. When you create a channel, the maximum length of the channel's `displayName` is 50 characters. This is the name that appears to the user in Microsoft Teams.

If you're creating a private channel, you can add a maximum of 200 members.

> [!NOTE]
> - Some special characters in the channel name will cause the [Get filesFolder](/graph/api/channel-get-filesfolder) API to return an error. For details, see [Known issues](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/known-issues/?search=16692).
> - When you create a private/shared channel, the SharePoint site might fail to provision. If the site fails to provision after 5 minutes, use the [Get filesFolder](/graph/api/channel-get-filesfolder) API to trigger provisioning.
> - You can create shared channels with only one owner initially. Adding multiple owners results in a `400 Bad Request` error code. After the initial request, you can add more owners using the [Add member to channel](/graph/api/channel-post-members) API.

## Permissions

Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](/graph/permissions-reference).

This API supports admin permissions. Microsoft Teams service admins can access teams that they are not a member of.

[!INCLUDE [permissions-table](../includes/permissions/channel-post-permissions.md)]

> [!NOTE]
> - The Group.ReadWrite.All and Directory.ReadWrite.All permissions are supported only for backward compatibility. We recommend that you update your solutions to use an alternative permission listed in the previous table and avoid using these permissions going forward.
> - The Channel.Create.Group permission uses [resource-specific consent](/microsoftteams/platform/graph-api/rsc/resource-specific-consent). In the future, Microsoft may require you or your customers to pay additional fees based on the amount of data imported using Teamwork.Migrate.All and/or [migration APIs](/microsoftteams/platform/graph-api/import-messages/import-external-messages-to-teams).
