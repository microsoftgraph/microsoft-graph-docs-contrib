# Create team

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Create a new [team](../resources/team.md).

> [!NOTE]
> When you create a team, the SharePoint site of the general channel might fail to provision. If the site fails to provision after 5 minutes, use the [Get filesFolder](/graph/api/channel-get-filesfolder) API to trigger provisioning.

[!INCLUDE [national-cloud-support](../../includes/all-clouds.md)]

## Permissions

Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](/graph/permissions-reference).

<!-- { "blockType": "permissions", "name": "team_post" } -->
[!INCLUDE [permissions-table](../includes/permissions/team-post-permissions.md)]

> [!NOTE]
> - The Teamwork.Migrate.All permission is only supported for [migration](/microsoftteams/platform/graph-api/import-messages/import-external-messages-to-teams). In the future, Microsoft may require you or your customers to pay additional fees based on the amount of data imported.
> - The Group.ReadWrite.All and Directory.ReadWrite.All permissions are supported only for backward compatibility. We recommend that you update your solutions to use an alternative permission listed in the previous table and avoid using these permissions going forward.

## HTTP request

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->

```http
POST /teams
```

## Request headers

| Header        | Value                     |
| :------------ | :------------------------ |
|Authorization|Bearer {token}. Required. Learn more about [authentication and authorization](/graph/auth/auth-concepts).|
| Content-Type  | application/json. Required. |

## Request body

In the request body, supply a JSON representation of a [team](../resources/team.md) object. Optionally, specify a value for the **firstChannelName** property to name the first channel that is created. The default value of the first channel is `General`.

## Response

If successful, this API returns a `202 Accepted` response that contains a link to the [teamsAsyncOperation](../resources/teamsasyncoperation.md).

## Examples

### Example 1: Delegated permissions

Here's an example of a minimal request. By omitting other properties, the client is implicitly taking defaults from the pre-defined template represented by `template`.

#### Request

# [HTTP](#tab/http)

### Example 2: Application permissions

Here's an example of a minimal request using application permissions. By omitting other properties, the client is implicitly taking defaults from the predefined template represented by `template`. When issuing a request with application permissions, a [user](../resources/user.md) must be specified in the `members` collection.

### Example 4: Create a team from group

The following example shows how you can create a new [team](../resources/team.md) from a [group](../resources/group.md), given a **groupId**.

A few things to note about this call:

* In order to create a team, the group you're creating it from must have a least one owner.
* The team that's created will always inherit from the group's display name, visibility, specialization, and members. Therefore, when making this call with the **group@odata.bind** property, the inclusion of team **displayName**, **visibility**, **specialization**, or **members@odata.bind** properties return an error.
* If the group was created less than 15 minutes ago, it's possible for the Create team call to fail with a 404 error code due to replication delays. We recommend that you retry the Create team call three times, with a 10-second delay between calls.
* Specifying a first channel name with the **firstChannelName** property isn't supported when you create a team from a group.

### Example 6: Create a team with a non-standard base template type

Base template types are special templates that Microsoft created for specific industries. These base templates often contain proprietary apps that aren't available in the store and team properties that aren't yet supported individually in Microsoft Teams templates.

To create a team from a non-standard base template, you want to change the `template@odata.bind` property in the request body from `standard` to point to the specific base template you‚Äôd like to create.

To learn more about supported base template types, see [Get started with Teams templates](/MicrosoftTeams/get-started-with-teams-templates).

> [!NOTE]
> It can take up to 24 hours for Teams users to see a custom template change in the gallery.

### Example 7: Create a team with a non-standard base template type with extended properties

Base template types can be extended with additional properties, enabling you to build on an existing base template with additional team settings, channels, apps, or tabs.

To learn more about supported base template types and supported properties, see [Get started with Teams templates](/MicrosoftTeams/get-started-with-teams-templates).

### Example 8: Create a team in migration mode

#### Request

The following example shows how to create a team for imported messages.

>**Note:** In the future, Microsoft may require you or your customers to pay additional fees based on the amount of data imported.

>**Note:** Teams created in migration mode only supports the `standard` template.

```http
POST https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/teams
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "@microsoft.graph.teamCreationMode": "migration",
  "template@odata.bind": "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/teamsTemplates('standard')",
  "displayName": "My Sample Team",
  "description": "My Sample Team‚Äôs Description",
  "createdDateTime": "2020-03-14T11:22:17.067Z"
}
```

#### Response

```http
HTTP/1.1 202 Accepted
Location: /teams('dbd8de4f-5d47-48da-87f1-594bed003375')/operations('3a6fdce1-c261-48bc-89de-1cfef658c0d5')
Content-Location: /teams('dbd8de4f-5d47-48da-87f1-594bed003375')
```

#### Error response

If the request is unsuccessful, this method returns a `400 Bad Request` response code. 

```http
400 Bad Request
```

The following are common reasons for this response:

* **createdDateTime** is set in the future.
* **createdDateTime** is correctly specified but the **teamCreationMode** instance attribute is missing or set to an invalid value.

### Example 9: Application permissions using user principal name

Here's an example of a minimal request using application permissions. By omitting other properties, the client is implicitly taking defaults from the predefined template represented by `template`. When issuing a request with application permissions, a [user](../resources/user.md) must be specified in the `members` collection.
