[!INCLUDE [national-cloud-support](../../includes/global-only.md)]

## Permissions

Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types).

<!-- { "blockType": "permissions", "name": "educationuser_list_taughtclasses" } -->
[!INCLUDE [permissions-table](../includes/permissions/educationuser-list-taughtclasses-permissions.md)]

> [!NOTE]
> Note that if the delegated token is used, users can only see information about their own classes.

## HTTP request

<!-- {
  "blockType": "ignored"
}
-->

```http
GET /education/me/taughtClasses
GET /education/users/{educationUserId}/taughtClasses
```

## Optional query parameters

You can use the OData query option `$orderby` to sort groups in an organization by the **displayName** values, as shown in the following example:

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->

```http
GET https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/groups?$orderby=displayName
```

You can also use the `$filter`, `$count` and `$search` query parameters to limit the response.

When items are added or updated for this resource, they are specially indexed for use with the `$count` and `$search` query parameters. There can be a slight delay between when an item is added or updated and when it is available in the index.

For more information on OData query options, see [OData query parameters](/graph/query-parameters).
