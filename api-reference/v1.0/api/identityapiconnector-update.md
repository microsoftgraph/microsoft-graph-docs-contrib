#### Response

The following example shows the response.

<!-- {
  "blockType": "response",
}

``` http
HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
```

### Example 2: Changing API connector to use client certificate authentication

This will overwrite any previous authenticationConfiguration settings. To change from Basic authentication to certificate authentication, use this. To add additional certificates to list of certificates, use the [Upload client certificate](../api/identityapiconnector-uploadclientcertificate.md) method. When using this method, consequent "Get" or "List" operations of API connectors, `authenticationConfiguration` will be of type [microsoft.graph.clientCertificateAuthentication](../resources/clientcertificateauthentication.md).
