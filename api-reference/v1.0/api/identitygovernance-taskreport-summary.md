# taskReport: summary

Namespace: microsoft.graph.identityGovernance

Get a [taskReportSummary](../resources/identitygovernance-taskreportsummary.md) object.

This API provides a summary of [task processing results](identitygovernance-taskreport-list-taskprocessingresults.md) for a specified time period. Because the volume of task processing results and task reports returned by the List API calls can be overwhelming, this summary allows the administrator to get a quick overview based on counts.
