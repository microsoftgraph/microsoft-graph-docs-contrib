# List members of a channel

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Retrieve a list of [conversationMembers](../resources/conversationmember.md) from a [channel](../resources/channel.md).

This method supports federation. Only a user who is a member of the shared channel can retrieve the channel member list.

> [!NOTE]
> The membership IDs returned by server must be treated as opaque strings. The client should not try to parse or make any assumptions about these resource IDs.
>
> The membership results could map to users from different tenants, as indicated in the response, in the future. The client should not assume that all members are from the current tenant only.
