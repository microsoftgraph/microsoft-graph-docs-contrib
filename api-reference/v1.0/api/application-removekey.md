# application: removeKey

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Remove a key credential from an [application](../resources/application.md). This method along with [addKey](application-addkey.md) can be used by an application to automate rolling its expiring keys.

> [!NOTE]
> [Create servicePrincipal](../api/serviceprincipal-post-serviceprincipals.md) and
[Update servicePrincipal](../api/serviceprincipal-update.md) operations can continue to be used to add and update key credentials for any application with application or a user's context.

As part of the request validation for this method, a proof of possession of an existing key is verified before the action can be performed.
