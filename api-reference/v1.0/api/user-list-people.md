|Name|Value|Description|
|:---------------|:--------|:-------|
|$filter|string|Limits the response to only those people whose record contains the specified criteria.|
|$orderby|string|By default the people in the response are sorted by their relevance to your query. You can change the order of the people in the response using the *$orderby* parameter.|
|$search|string|Search for people by name or alias. Supports Fuzzy matching. Parameter only works for searching the signed-in user's relevant people, not for searching people relevant to other users.

For information and examples, see the *Perform a fuzzy search* section at [Use the People API to get information about the people most relevant to you](/graph/people-insights-overview#perform-a-fuzzy-search). |
|$select|string|Comma-separated list of properties to include in the response. For optimal performance, only select the subset of properties needed.|
|$skip|int|Skip the first n results, useful for paging. This is not supported when using *$search*.|
|$top|int|The maximum number of results to be returned on a results page. For more information, see [top parameter](/graph/query-parameters?tabs=http#top-parameter).|
