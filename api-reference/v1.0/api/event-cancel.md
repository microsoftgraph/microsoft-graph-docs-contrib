# event: cancel

Namespace: microsoft.graph

This action allows the organizer of a meeting to send a cancellation message and cancel the event. 

The action moves the event to the Deleted Items folder. The organizer can also cancel an occurrence of a recurring meeting 
by providing the occurrence event ID. An attendee calling this action gets an error (HTTP 400 Bad Request), with the following
error message:

"Your request can't be completed. You need to be an organizer to cancel a meeting."

This action differs from [Delete](event-delete.md) in that **Cancel** is available to only the organizer, and lets
the organizer send a custom message to the attendees about the cancellation.
