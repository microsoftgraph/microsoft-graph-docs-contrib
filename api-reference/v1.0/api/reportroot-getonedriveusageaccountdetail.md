| :------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------- |
| Delegated (work or school account)     | Reports.Read.All                         |
| Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported.                           |

## HTTP request


<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } --> 

```http
GET /reports/getOneDriveUsageAccountDetail(period='{period_value}')
GET /reports/getOneDriveUsageAccountDetail(date={date_value})
```

## Function parameters

In the request URL, provide one of the following parameters with a valid value.

| Parameter | Type   | Description                              |
| :-------- | :----- | :--------------------------------------- |
| period    | string | Specifies the length of time over which the report is aggregated. The supported values for {period_value} are: D7, D30, D90, and D180. These values follow the format D*n* where *n* represents the number of days over which the report is aggregated. |
| date      | Date   | Specifies the date for which you would like to view the users who performed any activity. {date_value} must have a format of YYYY-MM-DD. As this report is only available for the past 30 days, {date_value} should be a date from that range. |

## Request headers

| Name          | Description                              |
| :------------ | :--------------------------------------- |
| Authorization | Bearer {token}. Required.                |
| If-None-Match | If this request header is included and the eTag provided matches the current tag on the file, a `304 Not Modified` response code is returned. Optional. |

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `302 Found` response that redirects to a preauthenticated download URL for the report. That URL can be found in the `Location` header in the response.

Preauthenticated download URLs are only valid for a short period of time (a few minutes) and do not require an `Authorization` header.

The CSV file has the following headers for columns.

- Report Refresh Date
- Site URL
- Owner Display Name
- Is Deleted
- Last Activity Date
- File Count
- Active File Count
- Storage Used (Byte)
- Storage Allocated (Byte)
- Owner Principal Name
- Report Period
