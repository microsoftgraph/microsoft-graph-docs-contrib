# Delete bundle

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Delete a [bundle][] of driveItems by using its **id**.
Deleting a bundle using this method permanently deletes the bundle and doesn't move it to the Recycle Bin.
It doesn't, however, remove the items that were referenced by the bundle.
They remain in their parent folders.
