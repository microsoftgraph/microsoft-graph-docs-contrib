# message: send

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Send an existing draft message.

The draft message can be a new message [draft](../api/user-post-messages.md), [reply draft](../api/message-createreply.md), [reply-all draft](../api/message-createreplyall.md), or a [forward draft](../api/message-createforward.md).

This method saves the message in the **Sent Items** folder.

Alternatively, [send a new message](../api/user-sendmail.md) in a single operation.
