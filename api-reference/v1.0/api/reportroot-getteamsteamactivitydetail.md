```

## Function parameters

| Parameter | Type   | Description                              |
| :-------- | :----- | :--------------------------------------- |
| period    | string | Specifies the length of time over which the report is aggregated. The supported values for {period_value} are: `D7`, `D30`, `D90`, and `D180`. These values follow the format D*n* where *n* represents the number of days over which the report is aggregated. Required. |
| date      | Date   | Specifies the date for which you would like to view details about activities across one or more teams. {date_value} must have a format of YYYY-MM-DD. As this report is only available for the past 30 days, {date_value} should be a date from that range. |

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `302 Found` response that redirects to a preauthenticated download URL for the report. That URL can be found in the `Location` header in the response.

- Report Refresh Date

- Team Id
- Team type
- Last Activity Date
- Report Period
- Active users
- Active Channels
- Guests
- Reactions
