# List includeApplications (for a user flow)
Namespace: microsoft.graph

List the applications linked to an external identities self-service sign up user flow that's represented by an [externalUsersSelfServiceSignupEventsFlow](../resources/externalusersselfservicesignupeventsflow.md) object. These are the applications for which the authentication experience that's defined by the user flow is enabled.

To find the user flow that's linked to an application, see [Example 4: List user flow associated with specific application ID](../api/identitycontainer-list-authenticationeventsflows.md#example-4-list-user-flow-associated-with-specific-application-id).
