# Delete accessPackageAssignmentRequestWorkflowExtension

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Delete an [accessPackageAssignmentRequestWorkflowExtension](../resources/accesspackageassignmentrequestworkflowextension.md) object. The custom workflow extension must first be removed from any associated [policies](../resources/accesspackageassignmentpolicy.md) before it can be deleted. Follow these steps to remove the custom workflow extension from any associated policies:

1. First retrieve the accessPackageCatalogId by calling the [Get accessPackageAssignmentPolicies](accesspackageassignmentpolicy-get.md) operation and appending `?$expand=accessPackage($expand=catalog)` to the query. For example, `https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/identityGovernance/entitlementManagement/assignmentPolicies/{id}?$expand=accessPackage($expand=catalog)`.
2. Use the access package catalog ID and retrieve the ID of the **accessPackageCustomWorkflowExtension** object that you want to delete by running the [List accessPackageCustomWorkflowExtensions](accesspackagecatalog-list-accesspackagecustomworkflowextensions.md) operation.
3. Call the [Update accessPackageAssignmentPolicy](accesspackageassignmentpolicy-update.md) operation to remove the custom workflow extension object from the policy.
