# channel: completeMigration

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Complete the message migration process by removing `migration mode` from a [channel](../resources/channel.md) in a team. `Migration mode` is a special state that prevents certain operations, like sending messages and adding members, during the data migration process.

After a **completeMigration** request is made, you cannot import additional messages into the team. You can add members to the team after the request returns a successful response.
