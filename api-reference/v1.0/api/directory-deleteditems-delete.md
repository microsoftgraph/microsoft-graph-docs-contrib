# Permanently delete an item (directory object)

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Permanently delete a recently deleted [application](../resources/application.md), [group](../resources/group.md), [servicePrincipal](../resources/serviceprincipal.md), or [user](../resources/user.md) object from [deleted items](../resources/directory.md). After an item is permanently deleted, it **cannot** be restored.

Permanently delete a recently deleted directory object from [deleted items](../resources/directory.md). The following types are supported:
- [certificateBasedAuthPki](../resources/certificatebasedauthpki.md)
- [certificateAuthorityDetail](../resources/certificateauthoritydetail.md)

After an item is permanently deleted, it **cannot** be restored.

Administrative units **cannot** be permanently deleted by using the **deletedItems** API. Soft-deleted administrative units will be permanently deleted 30 days after initial deletion unless they are restored.
