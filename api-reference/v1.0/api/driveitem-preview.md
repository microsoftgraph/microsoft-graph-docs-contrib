# driveItem: preview

Namespace: microsoft.graph

This action allows you to obtain a short-lived embeddable URL for an item in order to render a temporary preview.

If you want to obtain long-lived embeddable links, use the [createLink][] API instead.

> [!NOTE]
> The **preview** action is currently only available on SharePoint and OneDrive for Business.

[createLink]: driveitem-createlink.md

|:------------|:--------------|:-----------------------------------------------
| page        | string/number | Optional. Page number of document to start at, if applicable. Specified as string for future use cases around file types such as ZIP.
| zoom        | number        | Optional. Zoom level to start at, if applicable.

## Response

```json

    "getUrl": "https://www.onedrive.com/embed?foo=bar&bar=baz",
    "postParameters": "param1=value&param2=another%20value",
    "postUrl": "https://www.onedrive.com/embed_by_post"
}
```

The response will be a JSON object containing the following properties:

| Name           | Type   | Description
|:---------------|:-------|:---------------------------------------------------
| getUrl         | string | URL suitable for embedding using HTTP GET (iframes, etc.)
| postUrl        | string | URL suitable for embedding using HTTP POST (form post, JS, etc.)

Either getUrl, postUrl, or both might be returned depending on the current state of embed support for the specified options.

```
POST https://www.onedrive.com/embed_by_post
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

param1=value&param2=another%20value
```

### Page/zoom

The 'page' and 'zoom' options may not be available for all preview apps, but will be applied if the preview app supports it.
