# Create inferenceClassificationOverride

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Create an override for a sender identified by an SMTP address. Future messages from that SMTP address will be consistently classified
as specified in the override.

**Note**

- If an override already exists with the same SMTP address, then the **classifyAs** and **name** fields of that override are updated with the provided values.
- The maximum number of overrides supported for a mailbox is 1000, based on unique sender SMTP addresses.
- The POST operation supports creating only one override at a time.
