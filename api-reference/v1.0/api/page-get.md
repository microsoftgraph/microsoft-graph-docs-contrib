# Get page

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Retrieve the properties and relationships of a [page](../resources/page.md) object.

**Getting page information**

Access a page's metadata by page identifier:

```
GET /me/onenote/pages/{id}
```

**Getting page content**

You can use the page's `content` endpoint to get the HTML content of a page:

```
GET /me/onenote/pages/{id}/content[?includeIDs=true]
GET /me/onenote/pages/{id}/$value[?includeIDs=true]
```

The `includeIDs=true` query option is used to [update pages](../api/page-update.md).
