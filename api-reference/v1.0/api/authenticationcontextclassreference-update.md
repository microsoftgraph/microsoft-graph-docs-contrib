## HTTP request

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->

```http
PATCH /identity/conditionalAccess/authenticationContextClassReferences/{id}
```

## Request headers

| Name          | Description      |
|:--------------|:-----------------|
|Authorization|Bearer {token}. Required. Learn more about [authentication and authorization](/graph/auth/auth-concepts).|
| Content-Type  | application/json. Required. |

## Request body

[!INCLUDE [table-intro](../../includes/update-property-table-intro.md)]


|Property|Type|Description|
|:---|:---|:---|
|displayName|String|The display name is the friendly name of the authenticationContextClassReference. This value should be used to identify the authentication context class reference when building user facing admin experiences. For example, selection UX.|
|description|String| A short explanation of the policies that are enforced by authenticationContextClassReference. This value should be used to provide secondary text to describe the authentication context class reference when building user facing admin experiences. For example, selection UX. |
|isAvailable|Boolean| Indicates whether the authenticationContextClassReference has been published by the security admin and is ready for use by apps. When it is set to `false` it should not be shown in authentication context selection UX, or used to protect app resources. It will be shown and available for Conditional Access policy authoring. |

A request using an empty JSON object, with no properties, will create a new [authenticationContextClassReference](../resources/authenticationcontextclassreference.md) object, if one with the specified ID doesn't exist, and the properties are set `null` or have default values.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `204 No Content` response code. It doesn't return anything in the response body.
