## Optional query parameters
This method supports the [OData Query Parameters](https://developer.microsoft.com/graph/docs/concepts/query_parameters) to help customize the response.

You can use the `$filter` query parameter to filter shared items. For example, based on **type**:

`https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me/insights/shared?$filter=ResourceVisualization/Type eq 'PowerPoint'`

See the available container types and types you can filter by in [resourceVisualization](../resources/insights-resourcevisualization.md).

You can also retrieve files shared by a specific user. For example, by specifying the `lastshared/sharedby/address` property:

`https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me/insights/shared?$filter=lastshared/sharedby/address eq 'kellygraham@contoso.com'`

See the [sharingDetail](../resources/insights-sharingdetail.md) complex type.
