# Delete timeOffReason

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Mark a [timeOffReason](../resources/timeoffreason.md) as inactive by setting the **isActive** property. Every team must include at least one timeoff reason.

This method doesn't remove the specified [timeOffReason](../resources/timeoffreason.md) instance. [timeOffItem](../resources/timeoffitem.md) instances that have been assigned this reason remain assigned to this reason.
