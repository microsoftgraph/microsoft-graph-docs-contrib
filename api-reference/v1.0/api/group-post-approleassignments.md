# Grant an appRoleAssignment to a group

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Use this API to assign an app role to a group. All direct members of the group will be considered assigned. To grant an app role assignment to a group, you need three identifiers:

- `principalId`: The `id` of the group to which you are assigning the app role.
- `resourceId`: The `id` of the resource `servicePrincipal` which has defined the app role.
- `appRoleId`: The `id` of the `appRole` (defined on the resource service principal) to assign to the group.

Additional licenses might be required to [use a group to manage access to applications](/azure/active-directory/users-groups-roles/groups-saasapps).

## Permissions

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) | AppRoleAssignment.ReadWrite.All, Directory.AccessAsUser.All    |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported.    |
|Application | AppRoleAssignment.ReadWrite.All |

## HTTP request

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
POST /groups/{id}/appRoleAssignments
```

> [!NOTE]
> As a best practice, we recommend creating app role assignments through the `appRoleAssignedTo` relationship of the _resource_ service principal, instead of the `appRoleAssignments` relationship of the assigned user, group, or service principal.

## Request headers

| Name       | Description|
|:-----------|:----------|
| Authorization | Bearer {token}. Required.  |
| Content-type | application/json. Required. |

## Request body

In the request body, supply a JSON representation of an [appRoleAssignment](../resources/approleassignment.md) object.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `201 Created` response code and an [appRoleAssignment](../resources/approleassignment.md) object in the response body.

## Examples

### Request

Here is an example of the request.


# [HTTP](#tab/http)
<!-- {
  "blockType": "request",
  "name": "group_create_approleassignment_1"
}-->

```http
POST https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/groups/7679d9a4-2323-44cd-b5c2-673ec88d8b12/appRoleAssignments

{
  "principalId": "7679d9a4-2323-44cd-b5c2-673ec88d8b12",

In this example, `{id}` and `{principalId-value}` would both be the `id` of the assigned group.

### Response

Here is an example of the response. 

>**Note:** The response object shown here might be shortened for readability.

<!-- {
  "blockType": "response",
  "truncated": true,
  "@odata.type": "microsoft.graph.appRoleAssignment"
} -->

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-type: application/json

{
  "@odata.context": "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/$metadata#groups('7679d9a4-2323-44cd-b5c2-673ec88d8b12')/appRoleAssignments/$entity",
  "id": "pNl5diMjzUS1wmc-yI2LEkGgWqFFrFdLhG2Ly2CysL4",
  "deletedDateTime": null,
  "appRoleId": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",
  "createdDateTime": "2021-02-19T17:55:08.3369542Z",
  "principalDisplayName": "Young techmakers",
  "principalId": "7679d9a4-2323-44cd-b5c2-673ec88d8b12",
  "principalType": "Group",
  "resourceDisplayName": "Yammer",
  "resourceId": "076e8b57-bac8-49d7-9396-e3449b685055"
}
```

In this example, note that the value used as the user **id** in the request URL (`cde330e5-2150-4c11-9c5b-14bfdc948c79`) is the same as the **principalId** property in the body.
