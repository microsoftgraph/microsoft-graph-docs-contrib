# event: tentativelyAccept

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Tentatively accept the specified [event](../resources/event.md) in a user [calendar](../resources/calendar.md).

If the event allows proposals for new times, on responding tentative to the event, an invitee can choose to suggest an alternative time by including the **proposedNewTime** parameter. For more information on how to propose a time, and how to receive and accept a new time proposal, see [Propose new meeting times](/graph/outlook-calendar-meeting-proposals).
