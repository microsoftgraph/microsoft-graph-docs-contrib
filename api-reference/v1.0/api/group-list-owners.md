# List group owners

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Retrieve a list of the group's owners. The owners are a set of users or service principals who are allowed to modify the group object. Owners are currently not available in Microsoft Graph for groups that were created in Exchange, distribution groups, or groups that are synchronized from an on-premises environment.

> **Note:** Currently, service principals are not listed as group owners due to the staged rollout of service principals to the Microsoft Graph v1.0 endpoint.

## Permissions

Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](/graph/permissions-reference).

The following least privileged roles are supported for this operation:

- Group owners
- "Member" users
- "Guest" users - have [limited read permissions](/entra/fundamentals/users-default-permissions?context=graph/context#compare-member-and-guest-default-permissions)
- Directory Readers
- Directory Writers
- Groups Administrator
- User Administrator
- Exchange Administrator - for Microsoft 365 groups only
- SharePoint Administrator - for Microsoft 365 groups only
- Teams Administrator - for Microsoft 365 groups only
- Yammer Administrator - for Microsoft 365 groups only
