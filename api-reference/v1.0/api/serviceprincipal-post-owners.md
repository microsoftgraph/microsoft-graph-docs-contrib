# servicePrincipal: Add owner

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Use this API to add an owner for the [servicePrincipal](../resources/serviceprincipal.md). Service principal owners can be users, the service principal itself, or other service principals.

[!INCLUDE [national-cloud-support](../../includes/all-clouds.md)]

## Permissions
Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](/graph/permissions-reference).

[!INCLUDE [permissions-table](../includes/permissions/serviceprincipal-post-owners-permissions.md)]

> [!IMPORTANT]
> 
> In delegated scenarios with work or school accounts, the signed-in user must be assigned a supported [Microsoft Entra role](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference?toc=%2Fgraph%2Ftoc.json) or a custom role with a supported role permission. The following least privileged roles are supported for this operation.
> - Hybrid Identity Administrator
> - Cloud Application Administrator
> - Application Administrator
