## HTTP request


<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->

| :-------- | :----- | :--------------------------------------- |
| period    | string | Specifies the length of time over which the report is aggregated. The supported values for {period_value} are: D7, D30, D90, and D180. These values follow the format D*n* where *n* represents the number of days over which the report is aggregated. |
| date      | Date   | Specifies the date for which you would like to view the users who performed any activity. {date_value} must have a format of YYYY-MM-DD. As this report is only available for the past 30 days, {date_value} should be a date from that range. |

The CSV file has the following headers for columns.

- Report Refresh Date
- User Principal Name
- Display Name
- Is Deleted
- Deleted Date
- Last Activity Date
- Send Count
- Receive Count
- Read Count
- Meeting Created Count
