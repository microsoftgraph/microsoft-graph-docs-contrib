## HTTP request

<!-- {
  "blockType": "ignored"
}
-->
``` http
POST external/connections/{connectionsId}/items/{externalItemId}/addActivities
```

## Request headers

|Name|Description|
|:---|:---|
|Authorization|Bearer {token}. Required. Learn more about [authentication and authorization](/graph/auth/auth-concepts).|
|Content-Type|application/json. Required.|

## Request body

In the request body, supply a JSON representation of the parameters.

The following table shows the parameters that can be used with this action.

|Parameter|Type|Description|
|:---|:---|:---|
|activities|[microsoft.graph.externalConnectors.externalActivity](../resources/externalconnectors-externalactivity.md) collection|Collection of activities that involve an **externalItem**.|

## Response

If successful, this action returns a `200 OK` response code and a collection of [microsoft.graph.externalConnectors.externalActivityResult](../resources/externalconnectors-externalactivityresult.md) objects in the response body.

A `207 Multi-Status` response code indicates that only some of the added **externalActivity** instances were successfully processed. The caller should inspect the response payload, looking at the error field for each **externalActivityResult** to determine why the **externalActivity** instance was not processed and what action can be taken. A `null` **error** property indicates a successful **externalActivityResult**.
