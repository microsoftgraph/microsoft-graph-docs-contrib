> **Note:** If you need to perform an export operation, the response will include the download URL, file name, and size in the **exportfileMetadata property. You will be responsible for managing the actual download process. You can choose to download the file to your local computer or export it to your storage account.
> To automate the process and avoid the interactive sign-in page:
> 1. Provision the Microsoft Purview eDiscovery application by using [Create ServicePrincpal](../api/serviceprincipal-post-serviceprincipals.md) for the application ID b26e684c-5068-4120-a679-64a5d2c909d9.
> 2. When the application is provisioned, request user-delegated permissions for discovery.Download.Read from the tenant admin. This request should be made from your third-party application interacting with Microsoft Graph.
> 3. Make sure the tenant admin approves the request.
> 4. Add the scope for the application to your existing script and make sure the headers include ("X-AllowWithAADToken", "true");.
> By following these steps, the user authorization process will be automated, and you won't encounter a manual interactive sign-in page.
