# Create educationAssignmentResource

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Create an [assignment resource](../resources/educationassignmentresource.md). Only teachers can perform this operation.

You can create the following types of assignment resources:

- [educationFileResource](../resources/educationfileresource.md)
- [educationExcelResource](../resources/educationexcelresource.md)
- [educationWordResource](../resources/educationwordresource.md)
- [educationLinkResource](../resources/educationlinkresource.md)
- [educationPowerPointResource](../resources/educationpowerpointresource.md)
- [educationMediaResource](../resources/educationmediaresource.md)
- [educationTeamsAppResource](../resources/educationteamsappresource.md)

Every resource has an **@odata.type** property to indicate which type of resource is being created.

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> Before you can upload an assignment resource, you must [set up the resources folder](../api/educationassignment-setupresourcesfolder.md) for the [educationAssignment](../resources/educationassignment.md) to upload the files to.
