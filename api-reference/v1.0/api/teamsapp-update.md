# Update teamsApp

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Update an [app](../resources/teamsapp.md) previously published to the Microsoft Teams app catalog. To update an app, the **distributionMethod** property for the app must be set to `organization`.

This API specifically updates an app published to your organization's app catalog (the tenant app catalog).

[!INCLUDE [national-cloud-support](../../includes/global-us.md)]

## Permissions

Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](/graph/permissions-reference).

- Only Teams Service admins or a higher privileged role can call this API.

[!INCLUDE [permissions-table](../includes/permissions/teamsapp-update-permissions.md)]


> [!NOTE]
> * The Directory.ReadWrite.All permission is supported only for backward compatibility. We recommend that you update your solutions to use an alternative permission listed in the previous table and avoid using these permissions going forward.

## HTTP request

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->

```http
POST /appCatalogs/teamsApps/{id}/appDefinitions
```

## Query parameters

|Property|Type|Description|
|----|----|----|
|requiresReview| Boolean | This optional query parameter triggers the app review process. Users with admin privileges can submit apps without triggering a review. If users want to request a review before publishing, they must set **requiresReview** to `true`. A user who has admin privileges can opt not to set **requiresReview** or set the value to `false` and the app is approved and immediately published.|

## Request headers

| Header        | Value           |
|:--------------|:--------------  |
|Authorization|Bearer {token}. Required. Learn more about [authentication and authorization](/graph/auth/auth-concepts).|
| Content-Type  | application/zip. Required. |

## Request body

In the request body, include a Teams zip manifest payload. For details, see [Create an app package](/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/apps/apps-package).

>**Note:** Use the ID returned from the [List published apps](./appcatalogs-list-teamsapps.md) call to reference the app you'd like to update. Do not use the ID from the manifest of the zip app package.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `204 No Content` response code.
