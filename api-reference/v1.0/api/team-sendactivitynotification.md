## HTTP request

<!-- {
  "blockType": "ignored"
}
-->
``` http
POST /teams/{teamId}/sendActivityNotification
```

## Request headers
|Name|Description|
|:---|:---|
|Authorization|Bearer {token}. Required. Learn more about [authentication and authorization](/graph/auth/auth-concepts).|
|Content-Type|application/json. Required.|

## Request body
In the request body, supply JSON representation of the parameters.

The following table shows the parameters that can be used with this action.

|Parameter|Type|Description|
|:---|:---|:---|
|activityType|String|The activity type must be declared in the [Teams app manifest](/microsoftteams/platform/overview), except for the `systemDefault` [Reserved activity type](/graph/teams-send-activityfeednotifications/#reserved-activity-types), which provides free-form text in the `Actor+Reason` line of the notification.|
|chainId|Int64|Optional. The chain ID for the notification. Used to override a previous notification. Use the same `chainId` in subsequent requests to override the previous notification.|
|iconId|String| Optional. The unique icon ID that allows apps to send customized icons per activity type. Icon IDs must be present in the Teams app manifest schema. If the icon ID is specified in the manifest but missing from the API request body, the icon falls back to the default icon for the app. |
|previewText|[itemBody](../resources/itembody.md)|The preview text for the notification. Microsoft Teams shows the first 150 characters.|
|recipient|[teamworkNotificationRecipient](../resources/teamworknotificationrecipient.md)|The recipient of the notification. For more information, see [aadUserNotificationRecipient](../resources/aadusernotificationrecipient.md), [channelMembersNotificationRecipient](../resources/channelmembersnotificationrecipient.md), and [teamMembersNotificationRecipient](../resources/teammembersnotificationrecipient.md). |
| teamsAppId         | String                                                       | Optional. The Teams app ID of the Teams app associated with the notification. Used to disambiguate installed apps when multiple apps with the same Microsoft Entra ID app ID are installed for the same recipient user. Avoid sharing Microsoft Entra ID app IDs between Teams apps. |
|templateParameters|[keyValuePair](../resources/keyvaluepair.md) collection|The values for the template variables defined in the activity feed entry corresponding to `activityType` in the [Teams app manifest](/microsoftteams/platform/overview).|
|topic|[teamworkActivityTopic](../resources/teamworkactivitytopic.md)|The topic of the notification. Specifies the resource being talked about.|

The following resources are supported when setting the `source` value of the **topic** property to `entityUrl`:

- [team](../resources/team.md)
- [channel](../resources/channel.md)
- [chatMesage](../resources/chatmessage.md)
- [teamsTab](../resources/teamstab.md)

> **Note:** The entity URL must be same or child resource of the team in the URL. Additionally, the [Teams app](/microsoftteams/platform/overview) must be installed in the team.

## Response

If successful, this action returns a `204 No Content` response code.

### Example 2: Notify a user about a channel tab

Similar to the previous example, this example uses `entityUrl` for the `topic`. However, this example links to a [tab](../resources/teamstab.md) in a [channel](../resources/channel.md). The tab hosts a page showing the user the status of their hotel reservation. Selecting the notification takes the user to the tab, where they can check their reservation.

### Example 4: Notify a user about an event using custom topic

As seen in the previous examples, you can link to different aspects of the team. However, if you want to link to an aspect that isn't part of the team or isn't represented by Microsoft Graph, or you want to customize the name, you can set the source of the `topic` to `text` and pass in a custom value for it. `webUrl` is required when setting `topic` source to `text`.

### Example 5: Notify the team members about pending finance approval requests

The following example shows how you can send an activity feed notification to all team members. This example is similar to previous examples. However, in this case, the **recipient** is a [teamMembersNotificationRecipient](../resources/teammembersnotificationrecipient.md). The **teamId** specified in the **recipient** must match the **teamId** specified in the request URL.

> **Note:** The ability to send notifications to all team members is limited to teams with 10,000 members or less. If the team exceeds 10,000 members, none of the team members will receive a notification.

### Example 7: Notify about pending finance approval requests in channel message reply location

Similar to the previous example, this example uses `entityUrl` for the `topic`. However, this example links to a [channel message reply](../api/chatmessage-get.md#example-3-get-reply-to-a-message-in-a-channel). The channel message reply shows the status of the user's hotel reservation. Selecting the notification takes the user to the reply message in the channel, where they can check their reservation status.

### Example 8: Notify a user in a team about an event using a custom icon

If you want to notify a user in a team with a customized icon instead of the default app icon, you can set the optional **iconId** property in the request body.

>**Note:** The `activityType` in the manifest must contain the list of allowed icon IDs in order to use this parameter. The request validation fails if the app manifest is missing the customized list of icons. For more information, see [Public developer preview app manifest](/microsoftteams/platform/resources/schema/manifest-schema-dev-preview).
