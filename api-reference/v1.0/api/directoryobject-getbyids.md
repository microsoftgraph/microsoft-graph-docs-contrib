# directoryObject: getByIds

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Return the directory objects specified in a list of IDs.

>[!NOTE]
>This API has a [known issue](/graph/known-issues#incomplete-objects-when-using-getbyids-request). Not all directory objects returned are the full objects containing all their properties.

Some common uses for this function are to:

* Resolve IDs returned by functions (that return collections of IDs) such as [getMemberObjects](directoryobject-getmemberobjects.md) or [getMemberGroups](directoryobject-getmembergroups.md)  to their backing directory objects.
* Resolve IDs persisted in an external store by the application to their backing directory objects.

## Request body

In the request body, provide a JSON object with the following parameters.

| Parameter   | Type |Description|
|:---------------|:--------|:----------|
|ids|String collection| A collection of IDs for which to return objects.  The IDs are GUIDs, represented as strings.  You can specify up to 1000 IDs. |
|types|String collection| A collection of resource types that specifies the set of resource collections to search. If not specified, the default is [directoryObject](/graph/api/resources/directoryobject?view=graph-rest-v1.0), which contains all of the resource types defined in the directory. Any object that derives from [directoryObject](/graph/api/resources/directoryobject?view=graph-rest-v1.0) may be specified in the collection; for example: [user](/graph/api/resources/user?view=graph-rest-v1.0), [group](/graph/api/resources/group?view=graph-rest-v1.0), [device](/graph/api/resources/device?view=graph-rest-v1.0), and so on. To search for references to a [Cloud Solution Provider](https://partner.microsoft.com/cloud-solution-provider) partner organization specify [directoryObjectPartnerReference](/graph/api/resources/directoryobjectpartnerreference?view=graph-rest-v1.0). If not specified, the default is [directoryObject](/graph/api/resources/directoryobject?view=graph-rest-v1.0), which contains all of the resource types defined in the directory, except for references to a [Cloud Solution Provider](https://partner.microsoft.com/cloud-solution-provider) partner organization. The values are not case sensitive.|
