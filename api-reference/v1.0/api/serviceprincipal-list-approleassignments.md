# List appRoleAssignments granted to a service principal

Namespace: microsoft.graph


Retrieve the list of [appRoleAssignment](../resources/approleassignment.md) that have been granted to a service principal.

App roles that are assigned to service principals are also known as [application permissions](/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-permissions-and-consent#permission-types). Application permissions can be granted directly by creating app role assignments, or through a [consent experience](/azure/active-directory/develop/application-consent-experience).

>**Note** This request might have replication delays for app role assignments that were recently granted or removed.

[!INCLUDE [national-cloud-support](../../includes/all-clouds.md)]

## Permissions

Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](/graph/permissions-reference).
