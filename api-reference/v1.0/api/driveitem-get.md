# Get driveItem

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Retrieve the metadata for a [driveItem](../resources/driveitem.md) in a [drive](../resources/drive.md) by file system path or ID.
`item-id` is the ID of a drive item. It can also be the unique ID of a [SharePoint list item](../resources/listitem.md).

## HTTP request

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->

```http
GET /drives/{drive-id}/items/{item-id}
GET /drives/{drive-id}/root:/{item-path}
GET /groups/{group-id}/drive/items/{item-id}
GET /groups/{group-id}/drive/root:/{item-path}
GET /me/drive/items/{item-id}
GET /me/drive/root:/{item-path}
GET /sites/{site-id}/drive/items/{item-id}
GET /sites/{site-id}/drive/root:/{item-path}
GET /sites/{site-id}/lists/{list-id}/items/{item-id}/driveItem
GET /users/{user-id}/drive/items/{item-id}
GET /users/{user-id}/drive/root:/{item-path}
```

## Optional query parameters

This method supports the `$expand` and `$select` [OData query parameters](/graph/query-parameters) to customize the response.

You can use the [`$expand` query string parameter](/graph/query-parameters) to include the children of an item in the same call as retrieving the metadata of an item if the item has a **children** relationship.

You can also use the `includeDeletedItems=true` query parameter to return deleted items.
This query parameter is only valid when targeting a [driveItem](../resources/driveitem.md) by ID, and otherwise will be ignored.
This is currently only supported on OneDrive Personal.

## Request headers

|Name|Description|
|:---|:---|
|Authorization|Bearer {token}. Required. Learn more about [authentication and authorization](/graph/auth/auth-concepts).|
| if-none-match | String. If this request header is included and the eTag (or cTag) provided matches the current tag on the file, an `HTTP 304 Not Modified` response is returned. |

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and the [driveItem](../resources/driveitem.md) resource in the response body.
