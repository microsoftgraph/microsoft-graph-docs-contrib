[!INCLUDE [permissions-table](../includes/permissions/externalconnectors-external-post-connections-permissions.md)]

## HTTP request

<!-- {
  "blockType": "ignored"
}
-->
``` http
POST /external/connections
```

## Request headers
|Name|Description|
|:---|:---|
|Authorization|Bearer {token}. Required. Learn more about [authentication and authorization](/graph/auth/auth-concepts).|
|Content-Type|application/json. Required.|

## Request body
In the request body, supply a JSON representation of the [externalConnection](../resources/externalconnectors-externalconnection.md) object.

You can specify the following properties when creating an [externalConnection](../resources/externalconnectors-externalconnection.md).

|Property|Type|Description|
|:---|:---|:---|
|id|String|The connection ID. Required.|
|name|String|The connection name. Required.|
|description|String|The connection description. Required.|
|configuration|[microsoft.graph.externalConnectors.configuration](../resources/externalconnectors-configuration.md)|The connection configurations. Optional.|



## Response

If successful, this method returns a `201 Created` response code and an [externalConnection](../resources/externalconnectors-externalconnection.md) object in the response body.

>**Note:** When you create an external connection with a broken adaptive card for the result layout, the first call will fail with a `503 Service Unavailable`. When you try the call again, the second call will fail with a `409 Conflict` response that states that a connection with the same name already exists. This happens because the connection was created even though the first call failed with `503 Service Unavailable`. For more details, see [Known issues](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/known-issues/?search=19908).
