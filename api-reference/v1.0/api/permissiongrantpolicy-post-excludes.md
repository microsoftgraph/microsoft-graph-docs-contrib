# Create permissionGrantConditionSet in excludes collection of permissionGrantPolicy

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Add conditions under which a permission grant event is *excluded* in a permission grant policy. You do this by adding a [permissionGrantConditionSet](../resources/permissiongrantconditionset.md) to the **excludes** collection of a  [permissionGrantPolicy](../resources/permissionGrantPolicy.md).

[!INCLUDE [national-cloud-support](../../includes/all-clouds.md)]

## Permissions

Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](/graph/permissions-reference).
