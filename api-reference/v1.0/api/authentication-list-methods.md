# List methods

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Retrieve a list of authentication methods registered to a user. The authentication methods are defined by the types derived from the [authenticationMethod](../resources/authenticationmethod.md) resource type, and only the methods supported on this API version. See [Microsoft Entra authentication methods API overview](../resources/authenticationmethods-overview.md) for a list of currently supported methods.

We don't recommend using the authentication methods APIs for scenarios where you need to iterate over your entire user population for auditing or security check purposes. For these types of scenarios, we recommend using the [authentication method registration and usage reporting APIs](/graph/api/resources/authenticationmethods-usage-insights-overview).

[!INCLUDE [national-cloud-support](../../includes/global-us.md)]

## Permissions

The following tables show the least privileged permission or permissions required to call this API on each supported resource type. Follow [best practices](/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions) to request least privileged permissions. For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see theÂ [permissions reference](/graph/permissions-reference).
