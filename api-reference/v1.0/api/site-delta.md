# site: delta

Get newly created, updated, or deleted [sites](../resources/site.md) without having to perform a full read of the entire sites collection.

A **delta** function call for **sites** is similar to a GET request, except that by appropriately applying [state tokens](/graph/delta-query-overview) in one or more of these calls,
you can query for incremental changes in the **sites**. It allows you to maintain and synchronize a local store of a user's **sites** without having to fetch all the **sites** from the server every time.
The application calls the API without specifying any parameters.
The service begins enumerating sites and returns pages of changes to these sites, accompanied by either an **@odata.nextLink** or an **@odata.deltaLink**.
Your application should continue making calls using the **@odata.nextLink** until there's an **@odata.deltaLink**  in the response.

After you receive all the changes, you can apply them to your local state.
To monitor future changes, call the **delta** API by using the **@odata.deltaLink** in the previous response.

Any resources marked as deleted should be removed from your local state.

## Permissions

Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](/graph/permissions-reference).

<!-- { "blockType": "permissions", "name": "site_delta" } -->
[!INCLUDE [permissions-table](../includes/permissions/site-delta-permissions.md)]

## HTTP request

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->

```http
GET /sites/delta
```

## Query parameters

In the request URL, you can include the following optional query parameter.

| Parameter    | Type   | Description                                                                                                                          |
|:-------------|:-------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| token        | String | If the value is `latest`, the call returns an empty response with the latest delta token. If the value is a previous delta token, the call returns the new state since that token was issued.|

This method also supports the `$select`, `$expand`, and `$top` [OData query parameters](/graph/query-parameters) to customize the response.

## Request headers

|Header       |Value                    |
|-------------|-------------------------|
|Authorization|Bearer {token}. Required. Learn more about [authentication and authorization](/graph/auth/auth-concepts).|

## Request body

Don't supply a request body for this method.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and a collection of [site](../resources/site.md) objects in the response body.

In addition to the collection of **site** objects, the response also includes one of the following properties.

| Name             | Value  | Description                                                                                                                                     |
|:-----------------|:-------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| @odata.nextLink  | URL    | A URL to retrieve the next available page of changes if there are more changes in the current set.                                        |
| @odata.deltaLink | URL    | A URL returned instead of **@odata.nextLink** after all current changes are returned. Use this property to read the next set of changes in the future. |

In some cases, the service returns a `410 Gone` response code with an error response that contains one of the following error codes, and a `Location` header that contains a new `nextLink` that starts a fresh delta enumeration. It occurs when the service can't provide a list of changes for a given token; for example, if a client tries to reuse an old token after being disconnected for a long time, or if the server state changed and a new token is required.

After the full enumeration is completed, compare the returned sites with your local state and follow the instructions based on the error type.

| Error type                     | Instructions                                                                                                                               |
|:-------------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| resyncChangesApplyDifferences  | Replace any local sites with the versions from the server (including deletes) if you're sure that the service was up-to-date with your local changes when you last synchronized. Upload any local changes that the server doesn't know about. |
| resyncChangesUploadDifferences | Upload any local sites that the service didn't return and upload any sites that differ from the versions from the server. Keep both copies if you're not sure which one is more up-to-date.                                       |

#### Response

The following example shows the response that includes the first page of changes and the **@odata.nextLink** property that indicates that no more sites are available in the current set of sites. Your app should continue to request the URL value of **@odata.nextLink** until all pages of sites are retrieved.

#### Response

The following example shows the response that indicates that the site named `All Company` was deleted between the initial request and this request to update the local state.

The final page of sites includes the **@odata.deltaLink** property that provides the URL that can be used later to retrieve changes since the current set of sites.

<!-- { "blockType": "response", "truncated": true, "@odata.type": "Collection(microsoft.graph.site)", "scope": "site.read" } -->

            "root": {}
        }
    ]
}
```

### Example 3: Delta link request

In some scenarios, you might want to request the current `deltaLink` value without first enumerating all of the sites, lists, and webs. It can be useful if your app only wants to know about changes and doesn't need to know about existing sites.
To retrieve the latest `deltaLink`, call `delta` with the query string parameter `?token=latest`.

> **Note:** If you want to maintain a full local representation of the resources, you must use `delta` for the initial enumeration. Using `delta` is the only way to guarantee that you've read all of the data you need to.

#### Request

The following example shows a request.
