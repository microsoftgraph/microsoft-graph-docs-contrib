# Create temporaryAccessPassMethod
Namespace: microsoft.graph

Create a new [temporaryAccessPassAuthenticationMethod](../resources/temporaryaccesspassauthenticationmethod.md) object on a user. A user can only have one Temporary Access Pass that's usable within its specified lifetime. If the user requires a new Temporary Access Pass while the current Temporary Access Pass is valid, the admin can create a new Temporary Access Pass for the user, the previous Temporary Access Pass will be deleted, and a new Temporary Access Pass will be created.

## HTTP request

<!-- {
  "blockType": "ignored"
}
-->
``` http
POST /users/{id | userPrincipalName}/authentication/temporaryAccessPassMethods
```

## Request headers
|Name|Description|
|:---|:---|
|Authorization|Bearer {token}. Required. Learn more about [authentication and authorization](/graph/auth/auth-concepts).|
|Content-Type|application/json. Required.|

## Request body
In the request body, supply a JSON representation of the [temporaryAccessPassAuthenticationMethod](../resources/temporaryaccesspassauthenticationmethod.md) object.

The following table describes optional properties that can be used when creating the [temporaryAccessPassAuthenticationMethod](../resources/temporaryaccesspassauthenticationmethod.md).

|Property|Type|Description|
|:---|:---|:---|
|isUsableOnce|Boolean|Optional. Determines if the pass is limited to a one-time use. If `true`, the pass can be used once; if `false`, the pass can be used multiple times within its **lifetimeInMinutes** setting. A multi-use Temporary Access Pass (`isUsableOnce = false`), can only be created and used for sign-in if it is allowed by the  [Temporary Access Pass authentication method policy](../resources/temporaryaccesspassauthenticationmethodconfiguration.md).|
|lifetimeInMinutes|Int32|Optional. The lifetime of the temporaryAccessPass in minutes starting at creation time or at startDateTime, if set. Must be between 10 and 43200 (equivalent to 30 days). If not specified, the **defaultLifetimeInMinutes** setting in the [Temporary Access Pass authentication method policy](../resources/temporaryaccesspassauthenticationmethodconfiguration.md) is applied. |
|startDateTime|DateTimeOffset|Optional. The date and time when the temporaryAccessPass becomes available to use. If not specified, the Temporary Access Pass is available to use immediately after it's created.| 

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `201 Created` response code and a [temporaryAccessPassAuthenticationMethod](../resources/temporaryaccesspassauthenticationmethod.md) object in the response body.
