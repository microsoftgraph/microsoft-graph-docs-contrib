## HTTP request

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->

```http
GET /policies/appManagementPolicies/{id}/appliesTo
```

## Optional query parameters

This method supports the `$select`, `$filter`, and `$top` OData query parameters to help customize the response. You can apply `$filter` on properties of [application](../resources/application.md) or [servicePrincipal](../resources/serviceprincipal.md) objects that support `$filter`. For example, the following query retrieves the **appId** and **displayName** of applications or service principals that are assigned the policy.

``` http
https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/policies/appManagementPolicies/{id}/appliesTo?$select=appId,displayName
```

For general information, see [OData query parameters](/graph/query-parameters).
