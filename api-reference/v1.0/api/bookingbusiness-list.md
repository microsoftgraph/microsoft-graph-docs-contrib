# List bookingBusinesses

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Get a collection of [bookingBusiness](../resources/bookingbusiness.md) objects that has been created for the tenant.

This operation returns only the **id** and **displayName** of each Microsoft Bookings business in the collection. For performance considerations, it does not return other properties. You can get the other properties of a Bookings business by specifying its **id** in a [GET](bookingbusiness-get.md) operation.

> **Note:** Results are limited to 500 mailboxes. Pagination of the results is not currently supported.
