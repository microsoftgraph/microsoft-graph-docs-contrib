# List a user's oauth2PermissionGrants

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Retrieve a list of [oAuth2PermissionGrant](../resources/oAuth2PermissionGrant.md) entities, which represent delegated permissions granted to enable a client application to access an API on behalf of the user.

> [!NOTE]
> Querying the delegated permission grants for a user will only return delegated permissions grants that are specifically for the given user. Delegated permissions granted on behalf of all users in the organization are _not_ included in the response.

> [!NOTE]
> This request might have replication delays for delegated permission grants that were recently created, updated, or deleted.
