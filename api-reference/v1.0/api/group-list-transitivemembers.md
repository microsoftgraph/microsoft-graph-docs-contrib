# List group transitive members

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Get a list of the [group's](../resources/group.md) members. A group can have different object types as members. For more information about supported member types for different groups, see [Group membership](../resources/groups-overview.md#group-membership).

This operation is transitive and returns a flat list of all nested members. An attempt to filter by an OData cast that represents an unsupported member type returns a `400 Bad Request` error with the `Request_UnsupportedQuery` code.

## Permissions

Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](/graph/permissions-reference).

[!INCLUDE [permissions-table](../includes/permissions/group-list-transitivemembers-permissions.md)]

[!INCLUDE [limited-info](../../includes/limited-info.md)]

> **Note:** To list the members of a hidden membership group, the _Member.Read.Hidden_ permission is required.

## HTTP request

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->

```http
GET /groups/{id}/transitiveMembers
```

## Optional query parameters

This method supports the `$count`, `$filter`, `$search`, `$select`, and `$top` [OData query parameters](/graph/query-parameters) to help customize the response.
- OData cast is enabled. For example, `/groups/{id}/transitiveMembers/microsoft.graph.user` retrieves only users that are members of a group.
- `$search` is supported on the **displayName** and **description** properties only.
- The default and maximum page size is 100 and 999 group objects respectively.
- The use of query parameters with this API, except for `$expand`, is supported only with advanced query parameters. `$expand` isn't supported with advanced query parameters. For more information, see [Advanced query capabilities on directory objects](/graph/aad-advanced-queries).

## Request headers

| Name             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| :--------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|Authorization|Bearer {token}. Required. Learn more about [authentication and authorization](/graph/auth/auth-concepts).|
| ConsistencyLevel | eventual. This header and `$count` are required when using the `$search`, `$filter`, `$orderby`, or OData cast query parameters. It uses an index that might not be up-to-date with recent changes to the object. |

## Request body

Don't supply a request body for this method.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and a collection of [directoryObject](../resources/directoryobject.md) objects in the response body.

 An attempt to filter by an OData cast that represents an unsupported member type returns a `400 Bad Request` error with the `Request_UnsupportedQuery` code. For example, `/groups/{id}}/transitiveMembers/microsoft.graph.group` when the group is a Microsoft 365 group will return this error, because Microsoft 365 groups cannot have other groups as members.
