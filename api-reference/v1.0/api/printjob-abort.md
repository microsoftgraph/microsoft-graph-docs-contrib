# printJob: abort

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [cloudprinting-pricing-disclaimer](../../includes/cloudprinting-pricing-disclaimer.md)]

Abort a print job. Only applications using application permissions can abort a print job.

Aborting a print job will only succeed if there is a [printTask](../resources/printTask.md) in a `processing` state on the associated print job, started by a trigger that the requesting app created. For details about how to register a task trigger, see [Extending Universal Print to support pull printing](/graph/universal-print-concept-overview#extending-universal-print-to-support-pull-printing).

## Permissions
One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

In addition to the following permissions, the app's tenant must have an active Universal Print subscription and have either the Printer.Read.All or Printer.ReadWrite.All application permission.

|Permission type | Permissions (from least to most privileged) |
|:---------------|:--------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account)| Not Supported |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account)|Not Supported.|
