# List messages

Get the messages in the signed-in user's mailbox (including the Deleted Items and Clutter folders).

Currently, this operation returns message bodies in only HTML format.

There are two scenarios where an app can get messages in another user's mail folder:

* If the app has application permissions, or,
* If the app has the appropriate delegated [permissions](#permissions) from one user, and another user has shared a mail folder with that user, or, has given delegated access to that user. See [details and an example](/graph/outlook-share-messages-folders).

## Permissions
One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) | Mail.Read, Mail.ReadWrite    |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Mail.Read, Mail.ReadWrite    |
|Application | Mail.Read, Mail.ReadWrite |

## HTTP request

To get all the messages in a user's mailbox:

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
GET /me/messages
GET /users/{id | userPrincipalName}/messages
```

To get messages in a specific folder in the user's mailbox:

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
GET /me/mailFolders/{id}/messages
GET /users/{id | userPrincipalName}/mailFolders/{id}/messages
```
