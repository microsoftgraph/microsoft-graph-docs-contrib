# List messages

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Get the messages in the signed-in user's mailbox (including the Deleted Items and Clutter folders).

Depending on the page size and mailbox data, getting messages from a mailbox can incur multiple requests. The default page size is 10 messages. To get the next page of messages, simply apply the entire URL returned in `@odata.nextLink` to the next get-messages request. This URL includes any query parameters you may have specified in the initial request. 

Do not try to extract the `$skip` value from the `@odata.nextLink` URL to manipulate responses. This API uses the `$skip` value to keep count of all the items it has gone through in the user's mailbox to return a page of message-type items. It's therefore possible that even in the initial response, the `$skip` value is larger than the page size. For more information, see [Paging Microsoft Graph data in your app](/graph/paging).

Currently, this operation returns message bodies in only HTML format.

There are two scenarios where an app can get messages in another user's mail folder:

* If the app has application permissions, or,
* If the app has the appropriate delegated [permissions](#permissions) from one user, and another user has shared a mail folder with that user, or, has given delegated access to that user. See [details and an example](/graph/outlook-share-messages-folders).

> **Note** Be aware of the [known issue](/graph/known-issues#get-messages-returns-chats-in-microsoft-teams) that this operation includes Microsoft Teams chat messages in its response.

## Permissions
One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) | Mail.ReadBasic, Mail.Read, Mail.ReadWrite    |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Mail.ReadBasic, Mail.Read, Mail.ReadWrite    |
|Application | Mail.ReadBasic.All, Mail.Read, Mail.ReadWrite |

## HTTP request

To get all the messages in a user's mailbox:

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
GET /me/messages
GET /users/{id | userPrincipalName}/messages
```

To get messages in a specific folder in the user's mailbox:

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
GET /me/mailFolders/{id}/messages
GET /users/{id | userPrincipalName}/mailFolders/{id}/messages
```

## Optional query parameters
This method supports the [OData Query Parameters](https://developer.microsoft.com/graph/docs/concepts/query_parameters) to help customize the response.

### Using filter and orderby in the same query
When using `$filter` and `$orderby` in the same query to get messages, make sure to specify properties in the following ways:

1. Properties that appear in `$orderby` must also appear in `$filter`. 
2. Properties that appear in `$orderby` are in the same order as in `$filter`.
3. Properties that are present in `$orderby` appear in `$filter` before any properties that aren't.

Failing to do this results in the following error:

- Error code: `InefficientFilter`
- Error message: `The restriction or sort order is too complex for this operation.`

## Request headers
| Name       | Type | Description|
|:-----------|:------|:----------|
| Authorization  | string  | Bearer {token}. Required. |
| Prefer: outlook.body-content-type | string | The format of the **body** and **uniqueBody** properties to be returned in. Values can be "text" or "html". If the header is not specified, the **body** and **uniqueBody** properties are returned in HTML format. Optional. |


## Request body
Do not supply a request body for this method.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and collection of [Message](../resources/message.md) objects in the response body.

## Example
##### Request
This example gets the default, top 10 messages in the signed-in user's mailbox. It uses `$select` to return a subset of the properties of each message in the response.

# [HTTP](#tab/http)
<!-- {
  "blockType": "request",
  "name": "get_messages"
}-->
```msgraph-interactive
GET https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me/messages?$select=sender,subject
```

##### Response
Here is an example of the response. To get the next page of messages, apply the URL returned in `@odata.nextLink` to a subsequent GET request.
