# Add attachment

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Use this API to add an [attachment](../resources/attachment.md) to an existing [event](../resources/event.md). This operation limits the size of the attachment you can add to under 3 MB.

If an organizer adds an attachment to a meeting event, the organizer can subsequently [update](event-update.md) the event to send the attachment and update the event for each attendee as well.
