# Create a sharing link for a DriveItem

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Create a link to share a driveItem [driveItem](../resources/driveitem.md).

The **createLink** action creates a new sharing link if the specified link type doesn't already exist for the calling application.
If a sharing link of the specified type already exists for the app, the existing sharing link is returned.

DriveItem resources inherit sharing permissions from their ancestors.

[!INCLUDE [national-cloud-support](../../includes/all-clouds.md)]

## Permissions

Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](/graph/permissions-reference).

| **scope** | string | Optional. The scope of link to create. Either `anonymous`, `organization`, or `users`. |

### Link types

The following values are allowed for the **type** parameter.

| Type value | Description                                                                                  |
|:-----------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

| Value          | Description
|:---------------|:------------------------------------------------------------

## Response

If successful, this method returns a single [Permission](../resources/permission.md) resource in the response body that represents the requested sharing permissions.

The response will be `201 Created` if a new sharing link is created for the item or `200 OK` if an existing link is returned.

## Example

The following example requests a sharing link to be created for the DriveItem specified by {itemId} in the user's OneDrive.
The sharing link is configured to be read-only and usable by anyone with the link.
All existing permissions are removed when sharing for the first time if `retainInheritedPermissions` is false.

## Creating company sharable links

OneDrive for Business and SharePoint support company sharable links.
These are similar to anonymous links, except they only work for members of the owning organization.
To create a company sharable link, use the **scope** parameter with a value of `organization`.

## Creating embeddable links

When using the `embed` link type, the webUrl returned can be embedded in an `<iframe>` HTML element.
When an embed link is created the `webHtml` property contains the HTML code for an `<iframe>` to host the content.

**Note:** Embed links are only supported for OneDrive personal.
