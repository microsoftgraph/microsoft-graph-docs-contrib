# List appRoleAssignments granted for a service principal

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Retrieve all clients (users, groups, or client service principals) that have an [appRoleAssignment](../resources/approleassignment.md) for a given resource service principal.

For example, if the resource service principal is the service principal for the Microsoft Graph API, this API returns all service principals that have been granted any app-only permissions to Microsoft Graph. If the resource service principal is an application with app roles granted to users and groups, this API returns all the users and groups assigned app roles for this application.

>**Note** This request might have replication delays for app role assignments that were recently granted or removed.

[!INCLUDE [national-cloud-support](../../includes/all-clouds.md)]

## Permissions

Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](/graph/permissions-reference).
