## HTTP request

<!-- {
  "blockType": "ignored"
}
-->

```http
GET /education/classes/delta

## Request body

Do not supply a request body for this method.

## Response

If successful, this function returns an `200 OK` response code and an [educationClass](../resources/educationclass.md) collection in the response body. The response also includes a `@odata.nextLink` URL or a `@odata.deltaLink` URL.

- If a `@odata.nextLink` URL is returned, there are additional pages of data to be retrieved in the session. The application continues making requests using the `@odata.nextLink` URL until a `@odata.deltaLink` URL is included in the response.
- If a `@odata.deltaLink` URL is returned, there is no more data about the existing state of the resource to be returned. Persist and use the `@odata.deltaLink` URL to learn about changes to the resource in the future.

For details, see [Using delta query](/graph/delta-query-overview). For example requests, see [Get incremental changes for users](/graph/delta-query-users).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> educationClass deltas do not include deleted classes.
