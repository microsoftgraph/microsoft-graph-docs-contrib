# List apps in chat

Namespace: microsoft.graph

List all [app installations](../resources/teamsappinstallation.md) within a [chat](../resources/chat.md).

> **Note**:
If the chat is associated with an [onlineMeeting](../resources/onlinemeeting.md) instance, then, effectively, the **teamsApp**s installed in the meeting will be listed.
> [!NOTE]
> The `id` of a **teamsAppInstallation** resource is not the same value as the `id` of the associated **teamsApp** resource.


[!INCLUDE [national-cloud-support](../../includes/all-clouds.md)]

## Permissions

Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](/graph/permissions-reference).
