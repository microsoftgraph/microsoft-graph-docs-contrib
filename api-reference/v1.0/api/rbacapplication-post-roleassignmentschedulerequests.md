## Examples

### Example 1: Admin assigning a directory role to a principal

### Example 2: User activating their eligible role

#### Request

In the following request, a user identified by **principalId** `071cc716-8147-4397-a5ba-b2105951cc0b` activates their own *eligible role* to an Azure AD role identified by ID `8424c6f0-a189-499e-bbd0-26c1753c96d4`. The scope of their role is all directory objects in the tenant and the assignment is for five hours. To run this request, the calling user must have multi-factor authentication (MFA) enforced, and running the query in a session in which they were challenged for MFA.

To retrieve the details of their eligibility requests and identify the eligibility to activate, the user will call the [unifiedRoleEligibilitySchedule: filterByCurrentUser](unifiedroleeligibilityschedule-filterbycurrentuser.md) API.
