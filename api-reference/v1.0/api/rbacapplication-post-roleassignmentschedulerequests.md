# Create roleAssignmentScheduleRequests
Namespace: microsoft.graph

In PIM, carry out the following operations through the [unifiedRoleAssignmentScheduleRequest](../resources/unifiedroleassignmentschedulerequest.md) object:

+ Request active and persistent role assignments for a principal, with or without expiry dates.
+ Activate, deactivate, extend, or renew an eligible role assignment for a principal.

To call this API to update, renew, and extend assignments for yourself, you must have multifactor authentication (MFA) enforced, and running the query in a session in which they were challenged for MFA. See [Enable per-user Microsoft Entra multifactor authentication to secure sign-in events](/azure/active-directory/authentication/howto-mfa-userstates).

[!INCLUDE [national-cloud-support](../../includes/all-clouds.md)]

## Permissions
Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](/graph/permissions-reference).

### Example 2: User activating their eligible role

#### Request

In the following request, a user identified by **principalId** `071cc716-8147-4397-a5ba-b2105951cc0b` activates their own *eligible role* to a Microsoft Entra role identified by ID `8424c6f0-a189-499e-bbd0-26c1753c96d4`. The scope of their role is all directory objects in the tenant and the assignment is for five hours. To run this request, the calling user must have multifactor authentication (MFA) enforced, and running the query in a session in which they were challenged for MFA.

To retrieve the details of their eligibility requests and identify the eligibility to activate, the user will call the [unifiedRoleEligibilitySchedule: filterByCurrentUser](unifiedroleeligibilityschedule-filterbycurrentuser.md) API.
