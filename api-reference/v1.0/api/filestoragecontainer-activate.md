# fileStorageContainer: activate

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Activate a [fileStorageContainer](../resources/filestoragecontainer.md) object.

A **fileStorageContainer** object is created in an inactive state, as indicated by the **status** property. A container must be activated within 24 hours after creation, or it will be automatically deleted. Upon activation, the value of the status property changes from `inactive` to `active`.

A **fileStorageContainer** can be activated by calling the **activate** API, or any other API that updates or modifies the **fileStorageContainer** or its content. For example, uploading a file to a **fileStorageContainer**, adding permission to a **fileStorageContainer**, creating a custom property on a **fileStorageContainer**, or updating the properties of a **fileStorageContainer** can activate it.
