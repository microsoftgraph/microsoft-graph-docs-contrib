# Create educationSubmissionResource

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Add an [educationSubmissionResource](../resources/educationsubmissionresource.md) to a submission resource list. Only teachers and students can perform this operation.

The operation will not succeed if the **allowStudentsToAddResources** flag is not set to `true`.

To create a new file-based resource, upload the file to the resources folder associated with the submission. If the file doesn't exist or is not in that folder, the POST request will fail.

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> Before you can upload an assignment resource, you must [set up the resources folder](../api/educationassignment-setupresourcesfolder.md) for the [educationAssignment](../resources/educationassignment.md) to upload the files to.
> 

[!INCLUDE [national-cloud-support](../../includes/global-only.md)]

## Permissions
Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](/graph/permissions-reference).

## HTTP request
<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
POST /education/classes/{class-id}/assignments/{assignment-id}/submissions/{submission-id}/resources
```

## Request headers
| Header       | Value |
|:---------------|:--------|
|Authorization|Bearer {token}. Required. Learn more about [authentication and authorization](/graph/auth/auth-concepts).|
| Content-Type  | application/json. Required.  |

## Request body
In the request body, supply a JSON representation of the resource. The following are the supported types:

- [educationExcelResource](../resources/educationexcelresource.md)
- [educationFileResource](../resources/educationfileresource.md)
- [educationLinkResource](../resources/educationlinkresource.md)
- [educationPowerPointResource](../resources/educationpowerpointresource.md)
- [educationWordResource](../resources/educationwordresource.md) 
- [educationMediaResource](../resources/educationmediaresource.md).

>**Note:** The [educationExternalResource](../resources/educationexternalresource.md) is only an out resource, you can't POST a submission with it.

The `assignmentResourceUrl` isn't required in the request body; it's a read-only property.

## Response
If successful, this method returns a `201 Created` response code and an object according to the resource type in the response body.
