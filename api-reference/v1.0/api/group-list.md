# List groups

Namespace: microsoft.graph

List all the groups in an organization, including but not limited to Microsoft 365 groups. 

This operation returns by default only a subset of the properties for each group. These default properties are noted in the [Properties](../resources/group.md#properties) section. To get properties that are _not_ returned by default, do a [GET](group-get.md) operation for the group and specify the properties in a `$select` OData query option. The **hasMembersWithLicenseErrors** property is an exception and is not returned in the `$select` query.

## Permissions
One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) | Group.Read.All, Directory.Read.All, Group.ReadWrite.All, Directory.ReadWrite.All, Directory.AccessAsUser.All |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported.    |
|Application | Group.Read.All, Directory.Read.All, Group.ReadWrite.All, Directory.ReadWrite.All |

## HTTP request
<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
GET /groups
```

## Optional query parameters
To list only Microsoft 365 groups (aka unified groups), apply a filter on **groupTypes**:
<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```
GET https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/groups?$filter=groupTypes/any(c:c+eq+'Unified')
```

You can use the OData query option `$orderby` to sort groups in an organization by the **displayName**
values, as shown in the following example:
<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```
GET https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/groups?$orderby=displayName
```

You can also use the `$count` and `$search` query parameters to limit the response. The `$search` query parameter supports tokenization only on the **displayName** and **description** fields. Other fields default to `$filter` behavior. When items are added or updated for this resource, they are specially indexed for use with the `$count` and `$search` query parameters. There can be a slight delay between when an item is added or updated and when it is available in the index.

For more information on OData query options, see [OData query parameters](/graph/query-parameters).

## Request headers

| Name | Description |
|:---- |:----------- |
| Authorization  | Bearer {token}. Required. |
| ConsistencyLevel | eventual. This header and `$count` are required when using `$search`, or when using `$filter` with the `$orderby` query parameter. It uses an index that may not be up-to-date with recent changes to the object. |

## Request body
Do not supply a request body for this method.

## Response
If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and collection of [group](../resources/group.md) objects in the response body. The response includes only the default properties of each group.
