# List groups

Namespace: microsoft.graph

List all the groups available in an organization, excluding dynamic distribution groups. To retrieve dynamic distribution groups, [use the Exchange admin center](/exchange/recipients/dynamic-distribution-groups/dynamic-distribution-groups).

This operation returns by default only a subset of the properties for each group. These default properties are noted in the [Properties](../resources/group.md#properties) section. To get properties that are _not_ returned by default, do a [GET](group-get.md) operation for the group and specify the properties in a `$select` OData query option. The **hasMembersWithLicenseErrors** and **isArchived** properties are an exception and are not returned in the `$select` query.

> **Note:** This request might have replication delays for groups that were recently created, updated, or deleted.

## Permissions

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

| Permission type                        | Permissions (from least to most privileged)                                                            |
| :------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Delegated (work or school account)     | GroupMember.Read.All, Group.Read.All, Directory.Read.All, Group.ReadWrite.All, Directory.ReadWrite.All |
| Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported.                                                                                         |
| Application                            | GroupMember.Read.All, Group.Read.All, Directory.Read.All, Group.ReadWrite.All, Directory.ReadWrite.All |

## HTTP request

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->

```http
GET /groups
```

## Optional query parameters

This method supports the `$count`, `$expand`, `$filter`, `$orderBy`, `$search`, `$select`, and `$top` [OData query parameters](/graph/query-parameters) to help customize the response. `$skip` isn't supported. The default and maximum page sizes are 100 and 999 group objects respectively. Some queries are supported only when you use the **ConsistencyLevel** header set to `eventual` and `$count`. For more information, see [Advanced query capabilities on Azure AD directory objects](/graph/aad-advanced-queries).

To list only Microsoft 365 groups (aka unified groups), apply a filter on **groupTypes**:

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->

```http
GET https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/groups?$filter=groupTypes/any(c:c+eq+'Unified')
```

The `$search` query parameter supports tokenization only on the **displayName** and **description** fields and requires the **ConsistencyLevel** header. Fields other than **displayName** and **description** default to `$filter` `startswith` behavior.

Extension properties also support query parameters as follows:

| Extension type       | Comments                      |
|----------------------|-------------------------------|
| Schema extensions    | Returned only with `$select`. |
| Open extensions      | Returned only with `$expand`. |
| Directory extensions | Returned by default.          |

For more information on OData query options, see [OData query parameters](/graph/query-parameters). For more information about the use of **ConsistencyLevel** and `$count`, see [Advanced query capabilities on Azure AD directory objects](/graph/aad-advanced-queries).

| ConsistencyLevel | eventual. This header and `$count` are required when using `$search`, or in specific usage of `$filter`. For more information about the use of **ConsistencyLevel** and `$count`, see [Advanced query capabilities on Azure AD directory objects](/graph/aad-advanced-queries). |

#### Request

The following is an example of the request. This request requires the **ConsistencyLevel** header set to `eventual` because `$search` is in the request. For more information about the use of **ConsistencyLevel** and `$count`, see [Advanced query capabilities on Azure AD directory objects](/graph/aad-advanced-queries).

### Example 6: List dynamic security groups

#### Request

The following is an example of the request that filters by the **membershipRuleProcessingState** to retrieve dynamic groups. You may also filter by the **groupTypes** properties (that is, `$filter=groupTypes/any(s:s eq 'DynamicMembership')`). This request requires the **ConsistencyLevel** header set to `eventual` and the `$count=true` query string because the request uses the `not` operator of the `$filter` query parameter. For more information about the use of **ConsistencyLevel** and `$count`, see [Advanced query capabilities on Azure AD directory objects](/graph/aad-advanced-queries).

> **Note:** The `$count` and `$search` query parameters are currently not available in Azure AD B2C tenants.
