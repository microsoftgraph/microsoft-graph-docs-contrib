# Helpers (examples that aren't included in the docs)

These are things I had to add in the docs to make sure the Markdown-Scanner
tool was able to properly handle the Graph docs.


### Define the /me as singleton

<!-- {"blockType": "request", "name": "get_current_user" } -->
```http
GET https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me
```

<!-- {"blockType": "response", "@odata.type": "microsoft.graph.user", truncated: true } -->
```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK

{
}
```


### Define drives as an queryable entityset
<!-- {"blockType": "request", "name": "get_drive_from_id" } -->
```http
GET https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/drives/{drive-id}
```

<!-- {"blockType": "response", "@odata.type": "microsoft.graph.drive", truncated: true } -->
```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK

{
}
```


### define users as an queryable entityset

<!-- {"blockType": "request", "name": "get_users" } -->
```http
GET https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/users/{user-id}
```

<!-- {"blockType": "response", "@odata.type": "microsoft.graph.user", truncated: true } -->
```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK

{
}
```
