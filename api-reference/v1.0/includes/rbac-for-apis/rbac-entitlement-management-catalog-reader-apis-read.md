> [!TIP]
> In delegated scenarios with work or school accounts, the signed-in user must also be assigned an administrator role with supported role permissions through one of the following options:
> 
> - A [role in the Entitlement Management system](/entra/id-governance/entitlement-management-delegate) where the least privileged roles are:
>     - *Catalog reader*. **This is the least privileged option**
>     - *Catalog creator*
>     - *Access package manager*
> - More privileged [Microsoft Entra roles](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference?toc=%2Fgraph%2Ftoc.json) supported for this operation:
>     - Security Reader
>     - Global Reader
>     - Compliance Administrator
>     - Security Administrator
>     - Identity Governance Administrator
> 
> In app-only scenarios, the calling app can be assigned one of the preceding supported roles instead of the `EntitlementManagement.Read.All` application permission. The *Catalog reader* role is less privileged than the `EntitlementManagement.Read.All` application permission.
