<!-- Applies to eDiscovery write APIs -->

> [!TIP]
> In delegated scenarios with work or school accounts, the signed-in user must be assigned a supported [Microsoft Purview role](/purview/edisc-permissions) through one of the following options:
> 
> - **eDiscovery Manager**. This role allows members to create and manage eDiscovery cases they create, including creating custodians, holds, searches, and other case management tasks. However, eDiscovery Managers can only create and manage the cases they create. **This is the least privileged option for managing their own cases**.
> - **eDiscovery Administrator**. This role provides all the permissions of eDiscovery Manager, plus the ability to access and manage all eDiscovery cases in the organization, configure eDiscovery settings, and manage any case after adding themselves as a member.
> 
> Additional roles that provide write access to eDiscovery features:
> - **Compliance Administrator**. This role includes Case Management, Compliance Search, and Hold permissions.
> - **Organization Management**. This role includes Case Management, Compliance Search, Hold, and Search And Purge permissions.
> 
> The eDiscovery Manager and eDiscovery Administrator roles are part of the Microsoft Purview role groups and provide access to eDiscovery features through [role-based access control (RBAC)](/purview/edisc-permissions#rbac-roles-related-to-ediscovery).
