<!-- Applies to eDiscovery purge APIs -->

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In delegated scenarios with work or school accounts, the signed-in user must be assigned a supported [Microsoft Purview role](/purview/edisc-permissions) through one of the following options:
> 
> - **Organization Management**. This role allows members to perform bulk removal of data matching the criteria of a search. **This is the least privileged option for purging data**.
> 
> The Search And Purge role is required to permanently delete email messages that match search criteria. This role is only available to members of the Organization Management role group and should be used with extreme caution as deleted data cannot be recovered.
> 
> For more information about eDiscovery permissions and roles, see [Assign permissions in eDiscovery](/purview/edisc-permissions).
