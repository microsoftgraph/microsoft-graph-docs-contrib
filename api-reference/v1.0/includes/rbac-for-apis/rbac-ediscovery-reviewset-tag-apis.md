<!-- Applies to eDiscovery review set APIs -->

> [!TIP]
> In delegated scenarios with work or school accounts, the signed-in user must be assigned a supported [Microsoft Purview role](/purview/edisc-permissions) through one of the following options:
> 
> - **eDiscovery Manager**. This role allows members to access review sets in eDiscovery cases they create and are members of. **This is the least privileged option for accessing review sets in their own cases**.
> - **eDiscovery Administrator**. This role provides all the permissions of eDiscovery Manager, plus the ability to access review sets in all eDiscovery cases in the organization.
> - **Reviewer**. This role provides read-only access to review sets within eDiscovery cases where the user is a member. Reviewers can view and tag documents but cannot perform other case management tasks.
> 
> The Review role allows users to access review sets in eDiscovery cases they are members of. Users can view and tag documents in review sets but cannot preview search results or perform other search or case management tasks.
