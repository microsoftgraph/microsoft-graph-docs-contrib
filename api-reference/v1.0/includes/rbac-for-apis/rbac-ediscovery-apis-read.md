<!-- Applies to eDiscovery read APIs -->

> [!TIP]
> In delegated scenarios with work or school accounts, the signed-in user must be assigned a supported [Microsoft Purview role](/purview/edisc-permissions) through one of the following options:
> 
> - **eDiscovery Manager**. This role allows members to view and access eDiscovery cases they create, including searching and accessing case data. However, eDiscovery Managers can only access and manage the cases they create. **This is the least privileged option for managing their own cases**.
> - **eDiscovery Administrator**. This role provides all the permissions of eDiscovery Manager, plus the ability to view and access all eDiscovery cases in the organization.
> 
> Additional roles that provide read access to eDiscovery cases:
> - **Compliance Administrator**. This role includes Case Management and Compliance Search permissions.
> - **Organization Management**. This role includes Case Management and Compliance Search permissions.
> - **Reviewer**. This role provides read-only access to review sets within eDiscovery cases where the user is a member.
> 
> The eDiscovery Manager and eDiscovery Administrator roles are part of the Microsoft Purview role groups and provide access to eDiscovery features through [role-based access control (RBAC)](/purview/edisc-permissions#rbac-roles-related-to-ediscovery).
