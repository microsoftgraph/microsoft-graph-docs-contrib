> [!Note]
> SharePoint Embedded requires the `FileStorageContainer.Selected` permission to access the content of the container. This permission is different than the ones mentioned in the table. For more information, see [SharePoint Embedded authentication and authorization](/sharepoint/dev/embedded/concepts/app-concepts/auth#access-on-behalf-of-a-user).
> In addition to Microsoft Graph permissions, your app must have the necessary container type-level permission or permissions to call this API. For more information, see [container types](/sharepoint/dev/embedded/concepts/app-concepts/containertypes). To learn more about container type-level permissions, see [SharePoint Embedded authorization](/sharepoint/dev/embedded/concepts/app-concepts/auth#Authorization).
