# passiveDnsRecord resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph.security

[!INCLUDE [threatintelligence-api-disclaimer](../../includes/threatintelligence-api-disclaimer.md)]

Represents a passive DNS record. Passive DNS is a system of record that stores DNS resolution data for a given location, record, and timeframe. This historical resolution data set allows users to view which domains resolved to an IP address and vice versa. This data set allows for time-based correlation based on domain or IP overlap. Passive DNS might enable the identification of previously unknown or newly created threat actor infrastructure.

Inherits from [microsoft.graph.security.artifact](../resources/security-artifact.md).
