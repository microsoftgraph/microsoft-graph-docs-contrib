# alert resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph.security

This resource corresponds to the most recent batch of alerts generated by the Microsoft Graph security API. This resource represents potential security issues within a customer's tenant that Microsoft 365 Defender, or a security provider integrated with Microsoft 365 Defender, identified.

When a security provider detects a threat, it creates an alert in the system. Microsoft 365 Defender pulls this alert data from the security provider and consumes the alert data to return valuable clues in an [alert](security-alert.md) resource about any related attack, impacted assets, and associated [evidence](security-alertevidence.md). It automatically correlates other alerts with the same attack techniques or the same attacker into an [incident](security-incident.md) to provide a broader context of an attack. Aggregating alerts in this manner makes it easy for analysts to collectively investigate and respond to threats.

### alertSeverity values

| Member                     | Description                                                                                                                  |
| :--------------------------| :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| unknown       | Unknown severity.       |
| informational   | Alerts that might not be actionable or considered harmful to the network but can drive organizational security awareness on potential security issues.     |
| low                | Alerts on threats associated with prevalent malware. For example, hack-tools, nonmalware hack tools, such as running exploration commands and clearing logs, that often don't indicate an advanced threat that targets the organization. It can also come from an isolated security tool that a user in your organization is testing.  |
| medium             | Alerts generated from detections and response post-breach behaviors that might be a part of an advanced persistent threat (APT). This severity level includes observed behaviors typical of attack stages, anomalous registry change, execution of suspicious files, and so forth. Although some might be due to internal security testing, they're valid detections and require investigation as they might be a part of an advanced attack. |
| high               | Alerts commonly seen associated with advanced persistent threats (APT). These alerts indicate a high risk because of the severity of damage they can inflict on assets. Some examples are: credential theft tools activities, ransomware activities not associated with any group, tampering with security sensors, or any malicious activities indicative of a human adversary. |
| unknownFutureValue | Evolvable enumeration sentinel value. Don't use. |
