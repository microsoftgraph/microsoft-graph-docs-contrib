# userScopeTeamsAppInstallation resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Represents a [teamsApp](teamsapp.md) installed in the personal scope of a [user](user.md). Any bots that are part of the app will become part of a user's personal scope that the app is added to.
This type inherits from [teamsAppInstallation](teamsappinstallation.md).

> [!NOTE]
> The 'id' of an teamsAppInstallation resource is not the same value as the 'id' of the associated teamsApp resource.
