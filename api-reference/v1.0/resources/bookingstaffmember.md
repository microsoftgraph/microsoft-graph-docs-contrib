# bookingStaffMember resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Represents a staff member who provides services in a [bookingBusiness](bookingbusiness.md). 

Staff members can be part of the Microsoft 365 tenant where the **booking business** is configured, or they can use email services from other email providers.

When booking appointments, the Bookings API considers the following settings to determine a staff member's availability: 

1. By default, the hours of operation of the business (the **businessHours** property of the [bookingBusiness](bookingbusiness.md) entity) represent the general availability of the staff member.
2. If **useBusinessHours** is false, then the staff member's specific work hours (**workingHours** property of the **bookingStaffmember** entity) represent that member's general availability.
3. If **availabilityIsAffectedByPersonalCalendar** is true, then the Bookings API would first look at the staff member's generally available hours (as determined by either #1 or #2), and verify availability during those hours in the staff member's personal calendar, before making a booking.

Inherits from [bookingStaffMemberBase](bookingstaffmemberbase.md).

Microsoft Bookings supports a maximum of 100 staff members in a booking calendar.
