# conditionalAccessGrantControls resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Represents grant controls that must be fulfilled to pass the policy.

## Properties

| Property | Type | Description |
|:-------- |:---- |:----------- |
| operator | String | Defines the relationship of the grant controls. Possible values: `AND`, `OR`. |
| builtInControls | conditionalAccessGrantControl collection | List of values of built-in controls required by the policy. Possible values: `block`, `mfa`, `compliantDevice`, `domainJoinedDevice`, `approvedApplication`, `compliantApplication`, `passwordChange`, `unknownFutureValue`. |
| customAuthenticationFactors | String collection | List of custom controls IDs required by the policy. For more information, see [Custom controls](/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/controls). |
| termsOfUse | String collection | List of [terms of use](/graph/api/resources/agreement) IDs required by the policy. |

### Special considerations when using `passwordChange` as a control

Consider the following when you use the `passwordChange` control: 

- `passwordChange` must be accompanied by `mfa` using an `AND` operator. This combination ensures that the password will be updated in a secure way.
- `passwordChange` must be used in a policy containing `userRiskLevels`. This is designed to enable scenarios where users must use a secure change password to reset their user risk.
- The policy should target `all` applications, and not exclude any applications.
- The policy cannot contain any other condition except `users`, `applications` and `userRiskLevels`.

## Relationships

None.
