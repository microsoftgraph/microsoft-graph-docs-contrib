# oAuth2PermissionGrant resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Represents the delegated permissions that have been granted to an application's service principal.

Delegated permissions grants can be created as a result of a user consenting the an application's request to access an API, or created directly.

Delegated permissions are sometimes referred to as "OAuth 2.0 scopes" or "scopes".

## Properties

| Property | Type | Description |
|:---------------|:--------|:----------|
| id | String | Unique identifier for the **oAuth2PermissionGrant**. Read-only.|
| clientId | String | The **id** of the client [service principal](serviceprincipal.md) for the application which is authorized to act on behalf of a signed-in user when accessing an API. Required. Supports `$filter` (`eq` only). |
| consentType | String | Indicates if authorization is granted for the client application to impersonate all users or only a specific user. *AllPrincipals* indicates authorization to impersonate all users. *Principal* indicates authorization to impersonate a specific user. Consent on behalf of all users can be granted by an administrator. Non-admin users may be authorized to consent on behalf of themselves in some cases, for some delegated permissions. Required. Supports `$filter` (`eq` only). |
| principalId | String | The **id** of the [user](user.md) on behalf of whom the client is authorized to access the resource, when **consentType** is *Principal*. If **consentType** is *AllPrincipals* this value is null. Required when **consentType** is *Principal*. |
| resourceId | String | The **id** of the resource [service principal](serviceprincipal.md) to which access is authorized. This identifies the API which the client is authorized to attempt to call on behalf of a signed-in user. |
| scope | String | A space-separated list of the claim values for delegated permissions which should be included in access tokens for the resource application (the API). For example, `openid User.Read GroupMember.Read.All`. Each claim value should match the **value** field of one of the delegated permissions defined by the API, listed in the **publishedPermissionScopes** property of the resource [service principal](serviceprincipal.md). |
