# channel resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[Teams](../resources/team.md) are made up of channels, which are the conversations you have with your teammates. Each channel is dedicated to a specific topic, department, or project. Channels are where the work actually gets done - where text, audio, and video conversations open to the whole team happen,
where files are shared, and where tabs are added.
