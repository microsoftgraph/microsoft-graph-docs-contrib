# expirationPattern resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph

In [Microsoft Entra entitlement management](entitlementmanagement-overview.md), an access package assignment request is created by a user who wants to obtain an access package assignment. This request can include a schedule for when the user would like to have an assignment. An access package assignment that results from such a request also has a schedule. The expiration field of an [entitlementManagementSchedule](entitlementmanagementschedule.md) indicates when the access package assignment should expire.

In PIM, use this resource to define when a [unifiedRoleAssignmentScheduleRequest](unifiedroleassignmentschedulerequest.md) or [unifiedRoleEligibilityScheduleRequest](unifiedroleeligibilityschedulerequest.md) object expires. The settings allowed for this object are dependent on the [settings for the Microsoft Entra role](../api/unifiedrolemanagementpolicy-list-rules.md). For example, if the settings of the Microsoft Entra role specifies that permanent eligible assignments aren't allowed, specifying `noExpiration` for the **type** property returns an error.

## Properties
|Property|Type|Description|
|:---|:---|:---|
|duration|Duration|The requestor's desired duration of access represented in ISO 8601 format for durations. For example, PT3H refers to three hours.  If specified in a request, **endDateTime** should not be present and the **type** property should be set to `afterDuration`.|
|endDateTime|DateTimeOffset|Timestamp of date and time information using ISO 8601 format and is always in UTC time. For example, midnight UTC on Jan 1, 2014 is `2014-01-01T00:00:00Z`.|
