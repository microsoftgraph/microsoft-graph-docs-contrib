# educationUser resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph

A user in the system. This is an education-specific variant of the user with the same `id` that Microsoft Graph will return from the non-education-specific `/users` endpoint. This object provides a targeted subset of properties from the core [user](../resources/user.md) object and adds a set of education-specific properties such as `primaryRole`, student, and teacher data.

Inherits from [entity](../resources/entity.md).

| userPrincipalName    | String                                                             | The user principal name (UPN) of the user. The UPN is an Internet-style login name for the user based on the Internet standard RFC 822. By convention, this should map to the user's email name. The general format is alias@domain, where domain must be present in the tenant's collection of verified domains. This property is required when a user is created. The verified domains for the tenant can be accessed from the **verifiedDomains** property of [organization](organization.md). Supports `$filter` and `$orderby`. |

Supports `$filter`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When using Delegated permission scopes, Graph will only return a limited set of properties: `id`, `primaryRole`, `accountEnabled`, `displayName`, `givenName`, `surname`, `userPrincipalName`, `userType`, `onPremisesInfo`, `student/externalId`, `teacher/externalId`. If your application requires additional properties, you must use Application permission scopes.
