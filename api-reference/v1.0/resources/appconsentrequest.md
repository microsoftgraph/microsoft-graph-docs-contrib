# appConsentRequest resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Represents the request that a user creates when they request the tenant admin for consent to access an app or to grant permissions to an app. The details include the app that the user wants access to be granted to on their behalf and the permissions that the user is requesting.

The user can create a consent request when an app or a permission requires admin authorization and only when the [admin consent workflow](adminconsentrequestpolicy.md) is enabled.
