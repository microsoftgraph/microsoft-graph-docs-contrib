# meetingTimeSuggestionsResult resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph

A collection of meeting suggestions if there is any, or the reason if there isn't.

The following are the possible reasons that [findMeetingTimes](../api/user-findmeetingtimes.md) does not return any meeting suggestions.

|**emptySuggestionsReason value**|**Reasons**|
|:-----|:-----|
| attendeesUnavailable | All of the attendees' availability is known, but not enough attendees are available to reach the [meeting confidence](../api/user-findmeetingtimes.md#the-confidence-of-a-meeting-suggestion) threshold, which is 50% by default, for any time period.|
| attendeesUnavailableOrUnknown | Some or all of the attendees have unknown availability, causing the meeting confidence to fall below the set threshold, which is 50% by default. Attendee availability can become unknown if the attendee is outside of the organization, or there is an error obtaining free/busy information.|
| locationsUnavailable | The **isRequired** property of the [locationConstraint](locationconstraint.md) parameter is specified as mandatory, and yet there are no locations available at the calculated time slots. |
| organizerUnavailable | The **isOrganizerOptional** parameter is false and yet the organizer is not available during the requested time window. |
| unknown | The reason for not returning any meeting suggestions is not known.|
