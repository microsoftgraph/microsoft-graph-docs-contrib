# Use the Outlook mail REST API

Microsoft Graph lets your app get authorized access to a user's Outlook mail data in a personal or organization account.
With the appropriate delegated or application [mail permissions](/graph/permissions-reference#mail-permissions), your app can access the mail data of the signed-in user or any user in a tenant. For more information on access tokens, app registration, and delegated and application permissions, see [Authentication and authorization basics](/graph/auth/auth-concepts).

[!INCLUDE [outlook-mailbox-type-support](../../includes/outlook-mailbox-type-support.md)]

## Using the mail REST API

Mail API requests are performed on behalf of a [user](../resources/user.md) which can be identified by the user's **id** property (a unique GUID), email address,
or the `me` shortcut alias for the signed-in user.

Email messages are represented by the [message](../resources/message.md) resource and organized in a [mailFolder](../resources/mailfolder.md).
Messages and mail folders are identified by their **id** property, obtainable from `GET` operations.

>[!IMPORTANT] 
> In general, do not assume that **message** and **mailfolder** IDs are unique and always remain the same within a mailbox. They might change after certain
actions such as copy or move. You can choose to use [immutable IDs](/graph/outlook-immutable-id) to retain the same ID as long as the message remains in the same mailbox, _with the exception of sending a draft message, and a few other scenarios_. See [lifetime of immutable IDs](/graph/outlook-immutable-id#lifetime-of-immutable-ids) for details.

Message bodies can be in HTML or text format.

You can use well-known folder names such as `Inbox`, `Drafts`, `SentItems`, or `DeletedItems` to identify certain mail folders that exist by default for all users. For a list of supported well-known folder names, see [mailFolder resource type](../resources/mailfolder.md).

For example, you can get messages in the Outlook **Sent Items** folder of the signed-in user, without first getting the folder ID:

```http
GET /me/mailFolders('SentItems')/messages?$select=sender,subject
```

## Common use cases

The **message** resource exposes properties such as **categories**, **conversationId**, **flag**, and **importance** that correspond to features
available in the UI, allowing apps to automate or integrate with the built-in Outlook user experience.

The Microsoft Graph API also provides methods and actions that support common use cases of messages.
