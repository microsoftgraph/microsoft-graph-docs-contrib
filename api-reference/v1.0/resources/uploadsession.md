# uploadSession resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph

The **uploadSession** resource provides information about how to upload large files to OneDrive, OneDrive for Business, or SharePoint document libraries, or to Outlook [event](event.md) and [message](message.md) items as attachments.

## JSON representation

Here is a JSON representation of the resource

<!-- {
  "blockType": "resource",
  "optionalProperties": [ "uploadUrl", "nextExpectedRanges" ],
  "@odata.type": "microsoft.graph.uploadSession"
}-->

```json
{
  "uploadUrl": "https://sn3302.up.1drv.com/up/fe6987415ace7X4e1eF866337",
  "expirationDateTime": "2015-01-29T09:21:55.523Z",
  "nextExpectedRanges": ["0-"]
}
```

## Properties


| Property	     | Type              |Description
|:-------------------|:------------------|:------------------------------------
| expirationDateTime | DateTimeOffset    | The date and time in UTC that the upload session will expire. The complete file must be uploaded before this expiration time is reached.
| nextExpectedRanges | String collection | A collection of byte ranges that the server is missing for the file. These ranges are zero indexed and of the format "start-end" (e.g. "0-26" to indicate the first 27 bytes of the file). When uploading files as Outlook attachments, instead of a collection of ranges, this property always indicates a single value "{start}", the location in the file where the next upload should begin.
| uploadUrl          | String            | The URL endpoint that accepts PUT requests for byte ranges of the file.
