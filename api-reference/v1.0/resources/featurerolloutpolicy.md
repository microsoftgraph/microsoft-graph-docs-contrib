# featureRolloutPolicy resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Represents a feature rollout policy associated with a directory object. Creating a feature rollout policy helps tenant administrators to pilot features of Microsoft Entra ID with a specific group before enabling features for entire organization. This minimizes the impact and helps administrators to test and rollout authentication related features gradually.

The following are limitations of feature rollout:

- Each feature supports a maximum of 10 groups.
- The **appliesTo** field only supports groups.
- Dynamic groups and nested groups are not supported.

For more information about staged rollout, see [How to configure staged rollout in Microsoft Entra ID](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFTE1epYDFQ).

### Prerequisites for enabled features

The following are prerequisites for each of the features that are currently supported for rollout using this rollout policy.

#### Passthrough Authentication

* Identify a server running Windows Server 2012 R2 or later where you want the [PassthroughAuthentication](/azure/active-directory/hybrid/how-to-connect-pta) Agent to run. Ensure that the server is domain-joined, can authenticate selected users with Active Directory, and can communicate with Microsoft Entra ID on outbound ports / URLs.
* [Download](https://aka.ms/getauthagent) & install the Microsoft Entra Connect Authentication Agent on the server.
* To enable high availability, install additional Authentication Agents on other servers as described [here](/azure/active-directory/hybrid/how-to-connect-pta-quick-start#step-4-ensure-high-availability).
* Ensure that you've configured your [Smart Lockout](/azure/active-directory/authentication/howto-password-smart-lockout) settings appropriately. This is to ensure that your users' on-premises Active Directory accounts don't get locked out by bad actors.

#### SeamlessSso

* Enable [SeamlessSso](/azure/active-directory/hybrid/how-to-connect-sso) for the AD forests based on [these](/azure/active-directory/hybrid/tshoot-connect-sso#manual-reset-of-the-feature) instructions.

#### PasswordHashSync

* Enable [PasswordHashSync](/azure/active-directory/hybrid/whatis-phs) from the "Optional features" page in Microsoft Entra Connect.

#### EmailAsAlternateId

* Associate alternate email  with user accounts.

## Relationships
