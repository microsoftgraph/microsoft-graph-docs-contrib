# alertEvidence resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph.security

Represents evidence related to an [alert](security-alert.md).

The **alertEvidence** base type and its derived evidence types provide a means to organize and track rich data about each artifact involved in an **alert**. For example, an **alert** about an attacker's IP address signing in to a cloud service using a compromised user account can track the following evidence:
- [IP evidence](security-ipevidence.md) with the roles of `attacker` and `source`, remediation status of `running`, and verdict of `malicious`.
- [Cloud application evidence](security-cloudapplicationevidence.md) with a role of `contextual`.
- [Mailbox evidence](security-mailboxevidence.md) for the hacked user account with a role of `compromised`.

This resource is the base type for the following evidence types: 
* [amazonResourceEvidence](security-amazonresourceevidence.md)
* [analyzedMessageEvidence](security-analyzedmessageevidence.md)
* [azureResourceEvidence](security-azureresourceevidence.md)
