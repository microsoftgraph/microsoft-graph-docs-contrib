# appScope resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph

The scope of a role assignment determines the set of resources for which the principal has access. An app scope is a scope defined and understood by a specific application, unlike directory scopes that are shared scopes stored in the directory and understood by multiple applications.

App scopes support the following principal and scope scenarios:
+ A single principal and a single scope
+ Multiple principals and multiple scopes.
