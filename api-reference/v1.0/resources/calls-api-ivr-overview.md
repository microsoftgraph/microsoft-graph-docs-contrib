# IVR scenarios in calls

The following are the Interactive Voice Response (IVR) scenarios that the calling APIs in Microsoft Graph support:

- Playing an audio prompt - e.g., when a call is placed in a customer service agent's queue.
- Recording a response - e.g., to record the caller's audio, usually after they heard a prompt with options.
- Subscribing to tones - e.g., when you want to know what DTMF tones the caller selected, usually after hearing the audio prompt.
