# device resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Represents a device registered in the organization. Devices are created in the cloud using the Device Registration Service or by Intune. They're used by conditional access policies for multi-factor authentication. These devices can range from desktop and laptop machines to phones and tablets. Inherits from [directoryObject](directoryobject.md).

This resource is an open type that allows other properties to be passed in. You can also add your own data to custom properties as [extensions](/graph/extensibility-overview).

## Properties

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Specific usage of `$filter` and the `$search` query parameter is supported only when you use the **ConsistencyLevel** header set to `eventual` and `$count`. For more information, see [Advanced query capabilities on Azure AD directory objects](/graph/aad-advanced-queries#device-properties).

|complianceExpirationDateTime|DateTimeOffset| The timestamp when the device is no longer deemed compliant. The timestamp type represents date and time information using ISO 8601 format and is always in UTC time. For example, midnight UTC on Jan 1, 2014 is `2014-01-01T00:00:00Z`. Read-only. |
|deviceId|String| Unique identifier set by Azure Device Registration Service at the time of registration. This is an alternate key that can be used to reference the device object. Supports `$filter` (`eq`, `ne`, `not`, `startsWith`).|
|deviceMetadata|String| For internal use only. Set to `null`. |
|deviceVersion|Int32| For internal use only. |
|displayName|String|The display name for the device. Required. Supports `$filter` (`eq`, `ne`, `not`, `ge`, `le`, `in`, `startsWith`, and `eq` on `null` values), `$search`, and `$orderBy`.  |
| extensionAttributes | [onPremisesExtensionAttributes](onpremisesextensionattributes.md) | Contains extension attributes 1-15 for the device. The individual extension attributes are not selectable. These properties are mastered in cloud and can be set during creation or update of a device object in Azure AD. <br><br>Supports `$filter` (`eq`, `not`, `startsWith`, and `eq` on `null` values). |
|id|String|The unique identifier for the device. Inherited from [directoryObject](directoryobject.md). Key, Not nullable. Read-only. Supports `$filter` (`eq`, `ne`, `not`, `in`). |
|isCompliant|Boolean|`true` if the device complies with Mobile Device Management (MDM) policies; otherwise, `false`. Read-only.

Supports `$filter` (`eq`, `ne`, `not`).|
|isManaged|Boolean|`true` if the device is managed by a Mobile Device Management (MDM) app; otherwise, `false`. This can only be updated by Intune for any device OS type or by an [approved MDM app](/windows/client-management/mdm/azure-active-directory-integration-with-mdm) for Windows OS devices.

Supports `$filter` (`eq`, `ne`, `not`, `ge`, `le`, `in`).|
|onPremisesSyncEnabled|Boolean|`true` if this object is synced from an on-premises directory; `false` if this object was originally synced from an on-premises directory but is no longer synced; `null` if this object has never been synced from an on-premises directory (default). Read-only. Supports `$filter` (`eq`, `ne`, `not`, `in`, and `eq` on `null` values). |

|operatingSystemVersion|String|The version of the operating system on the device. Required. Supports `$filter` (`eq`, `ne`, `not`, `ge`, `le`, `startsWith`, and `eq` on `null` values). |
|physicalIds|String collection| For internal use only. Not nullable. Supports `$filter` (`eq`, `not`, `ge`, `le`, `startsWith`,`/$count eq 0`, `/$count ne 0`). |
|profileType|deviceProfileType|The profile type of the device. Possible values: `RegisteredDevice` (default), `SecureVM`, `Printer`, `Shared`, `IoT`.|
|systemLabels|String collection| List of labels applied to the device by the system. Supports `$filter` (`/$count eq 0`, `/$count ne 0`). |
|trustType|String| Type of trust for the joined device. Read-only. Possible values:  `Workplace` (indicates *bring your own personal devices*), `AzureAd` (Cloud only joined devices), `ServerAd` (on-premises domain joined devices joined to Azure AD). For more details, see [Introduction to device management in Azure Active Directory](/azure/active-directory/device-management-introduction) |

## Relationships
