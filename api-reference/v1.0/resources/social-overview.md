# Use the Microsoft Graph API to integrate people intelligence in an app

Microsoft Graph enables access to useful data about people and documents they interact with.

## Aggregate and extract specific information about people

Feature: People

You can use the [person](../resources/person.md) resource and the People API to aggregate information
about a person from across mail, contacts, and social networks. The results are ordered by their
relevance based on multiple communication and collaboration patterns and business relationships. The API
lets you browse, sort, select, filter, or search for persons based on your criteria.

For scenarios and examples, see [Get information about relevant people](/graph/people-example).

To use the API, see the following:

- [List people](../api/user-list-people.md)


## Help users get the most relevant documents for their work

Feature: Document insights

Use the insights API to identify the most relevant documents for a user:

- List documents [trending around](../api/insights-list-trending.md) a user
- List documents [used by](../api/insights-list-used.md) a user
- List documents [shared with or shared by](../api/insights-list-shared.md) a user
