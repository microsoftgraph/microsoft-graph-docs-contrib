# package resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph

The **package** resource indicates that a **driveItem** is the top-level item in a "package" or a collection of items that should be treated as a collection instead of individual items.

An example of a package is a OneNote notebook.
While the notebook is made up of files and folders that represent the contents of the notebook, the top level item that represents the notebook has a **package** facet to indicate to clients that this is a collection of data that should be treated special.

**driveItems** with the **package** facet do not include a **folder** or **file** facet but are conceptually similar to an item with a **folder** facet.

## JSON representation

<!-- { "blockType": "resource", "@odata.type": "microsoft.graph.package" } -->

{
  "type": "oneNote"
