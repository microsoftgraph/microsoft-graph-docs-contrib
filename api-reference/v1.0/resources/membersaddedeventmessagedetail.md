# membersAddedEventMessageDetail resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Represents the details of an event message about [members](../resources/conversationMember.md) added.
This message is generated when **members** are added to a [chat](../resources/chat.md), a [channel](../resources/channel.md), or a [team](../resources/team.md).
The **visibleHistoryStartDateTime** property for an event about **members** added to a **channel** is always set to `0001-01-01T00:00:00Z`, which indicates that all history is shared.

> **Note**: The **visibleHistoryStartDateTime** property for a [conversationMember](conversationmember.md) and the **membersAddedEventMessageDetail** message might have different values if the selected **shareHistoryTime** value for **members** in a **chat** is earlier than the initiatorâ€™s visible history time.


Inherits from [eventMessageDetail](../resources/eventmessagedetail.md).
