## Properties

| Property | Type | Description |
|:---------------|:--------|:----------|
| isEnabled                  | Boolean | Enables or disables service principal lock configuration. To allow the sensitive properties to be updated, update this property to `false` to disable the lock on the service principal. | 
| allProperties              | Boolean | Enables locking all sensitive properties. The sensitive properties are **keyCredentials**, **passwordCredentials**, and **tokenEncryptionKeyId**.                                                                                                           |
| credentialsWithUsageVerify | Boolean | Locks the keyCredentials and passwordCredentials properties for modification where credential **usage** type is `Verify`. This locks OAuth service principals.                                                   |
| credentialsWithUsageSign   | Boolean | Locks the keyCredentials and passwordCredentials properties for modification where credential **usage** type is `Sign`.                                                                 |
