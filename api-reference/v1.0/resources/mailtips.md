| Property	   | Type	|Description|

| customMailTip | String | A custom mail tip that can be set on the recipient's mailbox. |
| deliveryRestricted| Boolean | Whether the recipient's mailbox is restricted, for example, accepting messages from only a predefined list of senders, rejecting messages from a predefined list of senders, or accepting messages from only authenticated senders. |
| emailAddress | [emailAddress](../resources/emailaddress.md) | The email address of the recipient to get mailtips for. |
| error | [mailTipsError](../resources/mailtipserror.md) | Errors that occur during the [getMailTips](../api/user-getmailtips.md) action. |
| externalMemberCount | Int32 | The number of external members if the recipient is a distribution list. |
| isModerated |Boolean  | Whether sending messages to the recipient requires approval.

| mailboxFull | Boolean | The mailbox full status of the recipient. |
| maxMessageSize | Int32 | The maximum message size that has been configured for the recipient's organization or mailbox. |

It's also useful to senders to inform them that their message may leave the organization, helping them make the correct decisions about wording, tone and content.|
