# cloudPcDeviceImage resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Represents the image resource on a Cloud PC.

Inherits from [entity](../resources/entity.md).

|Method|Return type|Description|
|:---|:---|:---|
|[List](../api/virtualendpoint-list-deviceimages.md)|[cloudPcDeviceImage](../resources/cloudpcdeviceimage.md) collection|List the properties and relationships of [cloudPcDeviceImage](../resources/cloudpcdeviceimage.md) objects (operating system images) uploaded to Cloud PC.|
|[Get](../api/cloudpcdeviceimage-get.md)|[cloudPcDeviceImage](../resources/cloudpcdeviceimage.md)|Read the properties and relationships of a specific [cloudPcDeviceImage](../resources/cloudpcdeviceimage.md) object.|
|[Create](../api/virtualendpoint-post-deviceimages.md)|[cloudPcDeviceImage](../resources/cloudpcdeviceimage.md)|Create a new [cloudPcDeviceImage](../resources/cloudpcdeviceimage.md) object.|
|[Delete](../api/cloudpcdeviceimage-delete.md)|None|Delete a [cloudPcDeviceImage](../resources/cloudpcdeviceimage.md) object.|
|[Get source images](../api/cloudpcdeviceimage-getsourceimages.md)|[cloudPcSourceDeviceImage](../resources/cloudpcsourcedeviceimage.md) collection|Get [cloudPcSourceDeviceImage](../resources/cloudpcsourcedeviceimage.md) objects that can be uploaded and used on Cloud PCs.|

## Properties

|Property|Type|Description|
|:---|:---|:---|
|displayName|String|The display name of the associated device image. The device image display name and the version are used to uniquely identify the Cloud PC device image. Read-only.|
|errorCode|[cloudPcDeviceImageErrorCode](#cloudpcdeviceimageerrorcode-values)|The error code of the status of the image that indicates why the upload failed, if applicable. Possible values are: `internalServerError`, `sourceImageNotFound`, `osVersionNotSupported`, `sourceImageInvalid`, `sourceImageNotGeneralized`, `unknownFutureValue`, `vmAlreadyAzureAdJoined`, `paidSourceImageNotSupport`, `sourceImageNotSupportCustomizeVMName`, `sourceImageSizeExceedsLimitation`. Use the `Prefer: include-unknown-enum-members` request header to get the following values from this [evolvable enum](/graph/best-practices-concept#handling-future-members-in-evolvable-enumerations): `vmAlreadyAzureAdJoined`, `paidSourceImageNotSupport`, `sourceImageNotSupportCustomizeVMName`, `sourceImageSizeExceedsLimitation`. Read-only.|
|expirationDate|Date|The date when the image became unavailable. Read-only.|
|id|String|The unique identifier (ID) of the image resource on the Cloud PC. Read-only. Inherited from [entity](../resources/entity.md).|
|lastModifiedDateTime|DateTimeOffset|The data and time when the image was last modified. The timestamp represents date and time information using ISO 8601 format and is always in UTC. For example, midnight UTC on Jan 1, 2014 is `2014-01-01T00:00:00Z`. Read-only.|
|operatingSystem|String|The operating system (OS) of the image. For example, `Windows 10 Enterprise`. Read-only.|
|osBuildNumber|String|The OS build version of the image. For example, `1909`. Read-only.|
|osStatus|[cloudPcDeviceImageOsStatus](#cloudpcdeviceimageosstatus-values)|The OS status of this image. Possible values are: `supported`, `supportedWithWarning`, `unknown`, `unknownFutureValue`. The default value is `unknown`. Read-only.|
|sourceImageResourceId|String|The unique identifier (ID) of the source image resource on Azure. The required ID format is: "/subscriptions/{subscription-id}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.Compute/images/{imageName}". Read-only.|
|status|[cloudPcDeviceImageStatus](#cloudpcdeviceimagestatus-values)|The status of the image on the Cloud PC. Possible values are: `pending`, `ready`, `failed`, `unknownFutureValue`. Read-only.|
|version|String|The image version. For example, `0.0.1` and `1.5.13`. Read-only.|

### cloudPcDeviceImageErrorCode values

|Member|Description|
|:---|:---|
|internalServerError|Indicates that an internal server error occurred when processing the image.|
|sourceImageNotFound|Indicates that the source image is inaccessible or not found.|
|osVersionNotSupported|Indicates that the operating system version isn't supported.|
|sourceImageInvalid|Indicates that the source image is invalid for provisioning a Windows virtual machine (VM).|
|sourceImageNotGeneralized|Indicates that the uploaded image hasnâ€™t been generalized. Reupload the image after running the sysprep/generalize command. To learn more, see [Remove machine specific information by deprovisioning or generalizing a VM before creating an image](/azure/virtual-machines/generalize).|
|unknownFutureValue|Evolvable enumeration sentinel value. Don't use.|
|vmAlreadyAzureAdJoined|Indicates that the VM that generates a source image for creating a device image has already been joined to Microsoft Entra. This prevents the validation process from allowing the creation of a device image using such a source image.|
|paidSourceImageNotSupport|Indicates that this source image is built from another paid image from the Azure Marketplace and isn't supported; use another source to proceed.|
|sourceImageNotSupportCustomizeVMName|Indicates that a computer name setting issue exists on the resultant generalized image, which prevents the customization of the VM name with the provided image.|
|sourceImageSizeExceedsLimitation|Indicates that the size of the customer-uploaded source image exceeds the shared image gallery (SIG) limitations, which results in image creation failure.|

### cloudPcDeviceImageOsStatus values

|Member|Description|
|:---|:---|
|supported|Indicates that the Cloud PC device image operating system is active and ready to be used for provisioning.|
|supportedWithWarning|Indicates that the Cloud PC device image operating system is expired, but Cloud PC continues support. If users continue to use, they may not be able to get security updates.|
|unknown|Default. Indicates that the status of the operating system image for the Cloud PC device is unknown.|
|unknownFutureValue|Evolvable enumeration sentinel value. Don't use.|

### cloudPcDeviceImageStatus values

|Member|Description|
|:---|:---|
|pending|Indicates that the image upload is in progress.|
|ready|Indicates that the image is ready for use on Cloud PCs.|
|failed|Indicates that the image failed to upload. |
|unknownFutureValue|Evolvable enumeration sentinel value. Don't use.|

## Relationships
