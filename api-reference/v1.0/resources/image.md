# image resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph

The **image** resource groups image-related properties into a single structure.
If a [**driveItem**](driveitem.md) has a non-null **image** facet, the item represents a bitmap image.

>**Note:** If the service is unable to determine the width and height of the image, the **image** resource may be empty.

## JSON representation

<!-- { "blockType": "resource", "@odata.type": "microsoft.graph.image" } -->
```json
{
  "width": 100,
  "height": 200
}
```

## Properties

| Property   | Type  | Description                                |
|:-----------|:------|:-------------------------------------------|
| **height** | Int32 | Optional. Height of the image, in pixels. Read-only. |
| **width**  | Int32 | Optional. Width of the image, in pixels. Read-only.  |

## Remarks

In OneDrive for Business, this resource is returned on items that are expected to be images based on file extension.

For more information about the facets on a DriveItem, see [driveItem](driveitem.md).
