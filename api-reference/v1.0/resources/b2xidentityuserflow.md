# b2xIdentityUserFlow resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Represents a self-service sign up user flow within an Azure Active Directory tenant.

User flows are used to enable a [self-service sign up](/azure/active-directory/external-identities/self-service-sign-up-overview) experience for guest users on an application. User flows define the experience the end user sees while signing up, including which [identity providers](/azure/active-directory/external-identities/identity-providers) they can use to authenticate, along with which attributes are collected as part of the sign up process.

Inherits from base class [identityUserFlow](../resources/identityuserflow.md).

## Properties

|Property|Type|Description|
|:---------------|:--------|:----------|
|id|String|The name of the user flow. This is a required value and is immutable after it's created. The name will be prefixed with the value of `B2X_1_` after creation.|
|userFlowType|userFlowType|The type of user flow. For self-service sign-up user flows, the value can only be `signUpOrSignIn` and cannot be modified after creation.|
|userFlowTypeVersion|Single|The version of the user flow. For self-service sign-up user flows, the version is always `1`.|
|apiConnectorConfiguration|[userFlowApiConnectorConfiguration](../resources/userflowapiconnectorconfiguration.md)|Configuration for enabling an API connector for use as part of the self-service sign-up user flow. You can only obtain the value of this object using [Get userFlowApiConnectorConfiguration](../api/b2xidentityuserflow-get-apiConnectorConfiguration.md).|

## Relationships

| Relationship       | Type  |Description|
