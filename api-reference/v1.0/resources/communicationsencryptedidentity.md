# communicationsEncryptedIdentity resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Represents the identity of a user whose underlying identity isn't available to the application due to privacy restrictions. For example, in a group call, participants other than the one who invited a Skype consumer user don't have access to the identity of that user in the call roster.
