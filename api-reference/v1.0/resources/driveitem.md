# driveItem resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph

The **driveItem** resource represents a file, folder, or other item stored in a drive.

All file system objects in OneDrive and SharePoint are returned as **driveItem** resources. Items in SharePoint document libraries can be represented as [listItem][] or **driveItem** resources.

There are two primary ways of addressing a **driveItem** resource:

* By the **driveItem** unique identifier using `drive/items/{item-id}`
* By file system path using `/drive/root:/path/to/file`

For more information, see [addressing driveItems](/graph/onedrive-addressing-driveitems).

**driveItem** resources have facets modeled as properties that provide data about the driveItem's identities and capabilities.
For example:

* Folders have a [**folder facet**][folder]
* Files have a [**file facet**][file].
* Images have an [**image facet**][image] in addition to their file facet.
* Images taken with a camera (photos) have a [**photo facet**][photo] that identifies the item as a photo and provides the properties of when the photo was taken and with what device.

Items with the **folder** facet act as containers of items and therefore have a `children` reference pointing to a collection of **driveItems** under the folder.

>**Note:** In OneDrive for Business or SharePoint document libraries, the **cTag** property isn't returned, if the **driveItem** has a [folder][] facet.

## Relationships

| Relationship       | Type                        | Description

## Instance Attributes

Instance attributes are properties with special behaviors.
These properties are temporary and either define behavior the service should perform or provide short-term property values, like a download URL for an item that expires.

| Property name                     | Type   | Description
|:----------------------------------|:-------|:--------------------------------
| @microsoft.graph.conflictBehavior | string | The conflict resolution behavior for actions that create a new item. You can use the values *fail*, *replace*, or *rename*. The default for PUT is *replace*. An item is never returned with this annotation. Write-only.
| @microsoft.graph.downloadUrl      | string | A URL that can be used to download this file's content. Authentication isn't required with this URL. Read-only.
| @microsoft.graph.sourceUrl        | string | This instance annotation can be used to instruct the service to download the contents of the URL when issuing a PUT request, and stores it as the file. Write-only.

>**Notes:**
>The parameter `@microsoft.graph.conflictBehavior` should be included in the URL instead of the body of the request.
>
>The `@microsoft.graph.downloadUrl` value is a short-lived URL and can't be cached. The URL is invalidated after for a short period of time (1 hour).
Removing file permissions for a user might not immediately invalidate the URL.
>
>Using the `@microsoft.graph.sourceUrl` property for file uploading is [not supported](/onedrive/developer/rest-api/api/driveitem_upload_url?view=odsp-graph-online#remarks&preserve-view=true) in OneDrive for Business, SharePoint Online, and SharePoint Server 2016.

## JSON representation

The following JSON representation shows the resource type.

The **driveItem** resource is derived from [**baseItem**][baseItem] and inherits properties from that resource.
