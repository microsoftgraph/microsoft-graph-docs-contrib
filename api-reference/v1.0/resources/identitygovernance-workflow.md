# workflow resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph.identityGovernance

Represents workflows created using Lifecycle Workflows. Workflows, when triggered by execution conditions, automate parts of the lifecycle management process using tasks. These tasks can either be built-in tasks, or a custom task can be called using the custom task extension which integrate with Azure Logic Apps.

You can create up to 100 workflows in a tenant.

Inherits from [workflowBase](../resources/identitygovernance-workflowbase.md).

## Properties

|Property|Type|Description|

A workflow can only belong to one category. The possible values are: `joiner`, `leaver`, `mover`, `unknownFutureValue`. Inherited from [workflowBase](../resources/identitygovernance-workflowbase.md). Required.<br><br>Supports `$filter`(`eq`,`ne`) and `$orderby`|
