# Use the Microsoft Search API to query data

You can use the Microsoft Search API to query Microsoft 365 data in your apps.

Search requests run in the context of the signed-in user, identified using an [access token with delegated permissions](/graph/auth-v2-user).

## Common use cases

The Microsoft Search API provides a [query](../api/search-query.md) method to search across your data in Microsoft Search, where you pass a [searchRequest](searchRequest.md) in the request body, defining the specifics of your search.

This section lists the common use cases of the **query** method, based on the properties and parameters you set in the **query** [searchRequest](searchRequest.md) body.

Search requests run on behalf of the user. Search results are scoped to enforce any access control applied to the items.  For example, in the context of files, permissions on the files are evaluated as part of the search request. Users cannot access more items in a search than they can otherwise obtain from a corresponding GET operation with the same permissions and access control.

| Use cases | Properties to define in the query request body |
|:------------------|:---------|
|[Scope search results based on entity types](#scope-search-based-on-entity-types)| **entityTypes** |
|[Page results](#page-search-results) | **from** and **size** |
|[Get the most relevant emails](#get-the-most-relevant-emails) | **enableTopResults** |
|[Get selected properties](#get-selected-properties) | **fields** |
|[Use KQL in query terms](#keyword-query-language-kql-support) | **query** |

## Scope search based on entity types

Define the scope of the search request using the **entityTypes** property in the **query** request payload.
The following table describes the types available to query and the supported permissions to access the data.

| EntityType | Permission scope required to access the items| Source| Comment|
|:------------------|:---------|:---------|:---------|
|[message](message.md)|Mail.Read, Mail.ReadWrite| Exchange Online| Email messages.|
|[event](event.md) |Calendars.Read, Calendars.ReadWrite| Exchange Online|Calendar events. |
|[drive](drive.md)|Files.Read.All, Files.ReadWrite.All, Sites.Read.All, Sites.ReadWrite.All| SharePoint | Document libraries.|
|[driveItem](driveitem.md)|Files.Read.All, Files.ReadWrite.All, Sites.Read.All, Sites.ReadWrite.All| SharePoint and OneDrive | Files, folders, pages, and news. |
|[list](list.md)|Sites.Read.All, Sites.ReadWrite.All| SharePoint and OneDrive | Lists. Note that document libraries are also returned as lists. |
|[listItem](listitem.md)|Sites.Read.All, Sites.ReadWrite.All| SharePoint and OneDrive | List items. Note that files and folders are also returned as list items; **listItem** is the super class of **driveItem**. |
|[site](site.md)|Sites.Read.All, Sites.ReadWrite.All| SharePoint | Sites in SharePoint.|

## Page search results

Control pagination of the search results by specifying the following two properties in the **query** request body:

- **from** - An integer that indicates the 0-based starting point to list search results on the page. The default value is 0.

- **size** - An integer that indicates the number of results to be returned for a page. The default value is 25.

Note the following limits if you're searching the **event** or **message** entity:

- **from** must start at zero in the first page request; otherwise, the request results in an HTTP 400 `Bad request`.
- The maximum results per page (**size**) is 25 for **message** and **event**. 

There is no upper limit for SharePoint or OneDrive items. A reasonable page size is 200. A larger page size generally incurs higher latency.

Best practices:

- Specify a smaller first page in the initial request. For example, specify **from** as 0, **size** as 25.
- Paginate subsequent pages by updating the **from** and **size** properties. You can increase the page size in each subsequent request. The following table shows an example.

    | Page | from | size |
    |:-----|:-----|:-----|
    | 1    | 0 | 25 |
    | 2    | 25 | 50 |
    | 3    | 75 | 75 |
    | 4    | 150 | 100 |

## Get the most relevant emails

When searching the **message** entity, specifying **enableTopResults** as `true` returns a hybrid list of messages: the first three messages in the response are sorted by relevance; the remaining messages are sorted by date/time.

## Get selected properties

When searching an entity type, such as **message**, **event**, **drive**, **driveItem**, **list**, **listItem**, **site**, **externalItem**, you can include in the **fields** property specific entity properties to return in the search results. This is similar to using the [OData system query option, $select](/graph/query-parameters#select-parameter) in REST requests. The search API does not technically support these query options because the behavior is expressed in the POST body.

For all these entity types, specifying the **fields** property reduces the number of properties returned in the response, optimizing the payload over the wire.

The **listItem** and **externalItem** entities are the only supported entities that allow getting extended retrievable fields configured in the schema. You cannot retrieve extended properties from all the other entities by using the search API. For example, if you created a retrievable field for **externalItem** in the search schema, or if you have a retrievable custom column on a **listItem**, you can retrieve these properties from search. To retrieve an extended property on a file, specify the **listItem** type in the request.

If the **fields** specified in the request are either not present in the schema, or not marked as retrievable, they will not be returned in the response. Invalid fields in the request are silently ignored.

If you do not specify any **fields** in the request,  you will get the default set of properties for all types. For extended properties, **listItem** and **externalItem** behave differently when no **fields** are passed in the request:

- **listItem** will not return any custom field.
- **externalItem** will return all the fields marked with the **retrievable** attribute in the Microsoft Graph connector schema for that particular connection.

## Keyword Query Language (KQL) support

Specify free text keywords, operators (such as `AND`, `OR`), and property restrictions in KQL syntax in the actual search query string (**query** property of the **query** request body). The syntax and command depend on the entity types (in the **entityTypes** property) you target in the same **query** request body.

Depending on the entity type, the searchable properties vary. For details, see:

- [Email properties](/microsoft-365/compliance/keyword-queries-and-search-conditions#searchable-email-properties)
- [Site properties](/microsoft-365/compliance/keyword-queries-and-search-conditions#searchable-site-properties)

## Error handling

The search API returns error responses as defined by [OData error object definition](http://docs.oasis-open.org/odata/odata-json-format/v4.01/cs01/odata-json-format-v4.01-cs01.html#sec_ErrorResponse), each of which is a JSON object containing a code and a message.

## Known limitations

The search API has the following limitations:

- The **query** method is defined to allow passing a collection of one or more **searchRequest** instances at once. However, the service currently supports only a single [searchRequest](./searchrequest.md) at a time.

- The [searchRequest](./searchrequest.md) resource supports passing multiple types of entities at a time. However, currently the only supported combination is for SharePoint and OneDrive entityTypes: **driveItem**, **drive**, **site**, **list**, **listItem**.
Any combinations involving **message**, **event**, SharePoint and OneDrive types , or **externalItem** are currently not supported.  

- The **contentSource** property, which defines the connection to use, is only applicable when **entityType** is specified as `externalItem`.

- The search API does not support custom sort for **message**, **event** or  **externalItem**.

- The search API does not support aggregations for **message**, **event**, **site** or **drive**.

- Customizations in SharePoint search, such as a custom search schema or result sources, can interfere with the operation of the Microsoft Search API.
