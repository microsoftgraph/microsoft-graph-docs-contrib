# How to protect your company app data with Microsoft Intune

Namespace: microsoft.graph

> **Note:** Using the Microsoft Graph APIs to configure Intune controls and policies still requires that the Intune service is [correctly licensed](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/cloud-platform/microsoft-intune-pricing) by the customer.

Microsoft Intune app protection policies help protect your company data and prevent data loss.

You can use Intune app protection policies to help protect your company’s data. Because Intune app protection policies can be used independent of any mobile-device management (MDM) solution, you protect your company’s data with or without enrolling devices in a device management solution. By implementing app-level policies, you can restrict access to company resources and keep data within the purview of your IT department.

Use Graph resources to manage app protection polices in Intune. See the table of content for a list of resources.
