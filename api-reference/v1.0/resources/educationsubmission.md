# educationSubmission resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph

A submission represents the resources that an individual (or group) turn in for an assignment and the outcomes (such as grades or feedback) that are associated with the submission.

Submissions are owned by an assignment. Submissions are automatically created when an assignment is published. The submission owns two lists of resources. Resources represent the user/groups working area while the submitted resources represent the resources that have actively been turned in by students.  

The **status** property is read-only and the object is moved through the workflow via actions. 

If [setUpResourcesFolder](../api/educationsubmission-setupResourcesFolder.md) has not been called on an **educationSubmission** resource, the **resourcesFolderUrl** property is `null`.
