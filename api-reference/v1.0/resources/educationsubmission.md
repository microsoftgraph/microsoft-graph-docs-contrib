# educationSubmission resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Represents the resources that an individual (or group) turn in for an [assignment](educationassignment.md) and the outcomes (such as grades or feedback) that are associated with the **submission**.

Submissions are owned by an **assignment**. Submissions are automatically created when an **assignment** is published. The **submission** owns two lists of resources. Resources represent the user/groups working area while the submitted resources represent the resources that have actively been turned in by students.

The **status** property is read-only and the object is moved through the workflow via actions.

If [setUpResourcesFolder](../api/educationsubmission-setupResourcesFolder.md) hasn't been called on an **educationSubmission** resource, the **resourcesFolderUrl** property is `null`.
