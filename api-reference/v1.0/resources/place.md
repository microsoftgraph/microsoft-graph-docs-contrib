# place resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Represents basic location attributes such as name, physical address, and geographic coordinates. This is the base type for richer location types such as [room](room.md) and [roomList](roomlist.md).

### Using the places API
Exchange Online administrators can organize meeting rooms in a tenant into room lists. Using the places API, you can get all the room lists or rooms in the tenant, or get all the rooms in a specific room list.

Places like [room](room.md) and [roomList](roomlist.md) contain the basic **id**, display name and email address. In addition, they contain navigational information like physical address and geographical coordinates, and in the case of rooms, other relevant information such as AV capabilities, floor number, and capacity.

The [findRooms](/graph/api/user-findrooms) and [findRoomLists](/graph/api/user-findroomlists) functions support similar lookup for rooms and room lists in a tenant. The following is a comparison between the places API and these functions.  If you are creating a production app, choose the places API as the API is now generally available in v1.0. Plan to update any existing code that uses **findRooms** or **findRoomLists** to use the places API, because **findRooms** or **findRoomLists** will be deprecated, and a timeline will be announced.

|Places API |findRooms and findRoomLists functions|
|:------------------------------------|:-----------------------------|
|Supports getting all the rooms or room lists in a tenant, and all the rooms in a room list | Similar support - get all the rooms or room lists in a tenant, and all the rooms in a room list|
|[List places](../api/place-list.md) can return more than 100 rooms in a tenant | [findRooms](/graph/api/user-findrooms) returns up to the first 100 rooms in a tenant |
|Supports [getting an individual room or room list](../api/place-get.md) in a tenant | Does not support getting an individual room or room list in a tenant
|Defines the specific entities of [room](room.md) and [roomList](roomlist.md) which specify a richer property set, in addition to the display name and SMTP address. | Each room and room list is of a lighter weight [emailAddress](emailaddress.md) type which specifies only the display name and SMTP address|
|Supports only organizational scenarios with delegated (work or school accounts) or application permissions | Similar support for only organizational scenarios with delegated or application permissions|
|Supports [updating an individual room or room list](../api/place-update.md) in a tenant | Does not support updating an individual room or room list in a tenant
