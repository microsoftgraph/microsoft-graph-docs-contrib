# group resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Represents a Microsoft Entra group, a Microsoft 365 group, or a security group. This resource is an open type that allows other properties to be passed in.

Inherits from [directoryObject](directoryobject.md).

For performance reasons, the [create](../api/group-post-groups.md), [get](../api/group-get.md), and [list](../api/group-list.md) operations return only a subset of more commonly used properties by default. These _default_ properties are noted in the [Properties](#properties) section. To get any of the properties not returned by default, specify them in a `$select` OData query option.

This resource supports:

- Adding your data to custom properties as [extensions](/graph/extensibility-overview).
- Subscribing to [change notifications](/graph/webhooks).
- Using [delta query](/graph/delta-query-overview) to track incremental additions, deletions, and updates, by providing a [delta](../api/group-delta.md) function.
