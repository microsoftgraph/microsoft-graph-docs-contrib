# Overview of access reviews APIs

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Use [Microsoft Entra access reviews](/entra/id-governance/access-reviews-overview) to configure one-time or recurring access reviews for attestation of a principal's right to access Microsoft Entra resources. The principals are users or applications (service principals). The Microsoft Entra resources include groups, applications (service principals), access packages, and privileged roles. Access reviews is a feature of Microsoft Entra ID Governance.

Typical customer scenarios for access reviews include:

- Customers can review and certify guest user access to groups through group memberships. Reviewers can use the insights that are provided to efficiently decide whether guests should have continued access.
- Customers can review and certify employee access to Microsoft Entra resources.
- Customers can review and audit assignments to Microsoft Entra ID privileged roles. This supports organizations in the management of privileged access.

The tenant where an access review is being created or managed via the API must have sufficient purchased or trial licenses. For more information about the license requirements, see [Access reviews license requirements](/azure/active-directory/governance/access-reviews-overview#license-requirements).

## Role and application permission authorization checks

The following [Microsoft Entra roles](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference?toc=%2Fgraph%2Ftoc.json) are required for a calling user to manage access reviews.

| Operation | Application permissions | Least privileged directory role of the calling user |
|:------------------|:------------|:--------------------------------------------|
| Read | AccessReview.Read.All or AccessReview.ReadWrite.All | Global Reader, Security Administrator, Security Reader or User Administrator |
| Create, Update or Delete | AccessReview.ReadWrite.All | User Administrator |

In addition, a user who is an assigned reviewer of an access review can manage their decisions, without needing to be in a directory role.
