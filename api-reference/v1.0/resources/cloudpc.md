# cloudPC resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Represents a cloud-managed virtual desktop. This Cloud PC is also enrolled into Intune and managed through the Microsoft Endpoint Manager portal, so the Cloud PC also has a corresponding Intune managed device ID.

Inherits from [entity](../resources/entity.md).
