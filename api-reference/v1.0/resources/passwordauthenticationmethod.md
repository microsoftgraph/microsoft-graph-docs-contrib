# passwordAuthenticationMethod resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph


A representation of a user's password. For security, the password itself will never be returned in the object, but action can be taken to reset a password.

This is a derived type that inherits from the [authenticationMethod](authenticationmethod.md) resource type.
