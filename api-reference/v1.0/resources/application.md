# application resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Represents an application. Any application that outsources authentication to Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) must be registered in a directory. Application registration involves telling Azure AD about your application, including the URL where it's located, the URL to send replies after authentication, the URI to identify your application, and more. For more information, see [Basics of Registering an Application in Azure AD](/azure/active-directory/develop/authentication-vs-authorization#basics-of-registering-an-application-in-azure-ad). Inherits from [directoryObject](directoryobject.md).

This resource supports using [delta query](/graph/delta-query-overview) to track incremental additions, deletions, and updates, by providing a [delta](../api/application-delta.md) function.

| Property | Type | Description |
|:---------------|:--------|:----------|
| addIns | [addIn](addin.md) collection| Defines custom behavior that a consuming service can use to call an app in specific contexts. For example, applications that can render file streams [may set the addIns property](/onedrive/developer/file-handlers/?view=odsp-graph-online) for its "FileHandler" functionality. This will let services like Office 365 call the application in the context of a document the user is working on. |
| api | [apiApplication](apiapplication.md) | Specifies settings for an application that implements a web API. |
| appId | String | The unique identifier for the application that is assigned to an application by Azure AD. Not nullable. Read-only. |
| applicationTemplateId | String | Unique identifier of the applicationTemplate. |
| appRoles | [appRole](approle.md) collection | The collection of roles assigned to the application. With [app role assignments](approleassignment.md), these roles can be assigned to users, groups, or service principals associated with other applications. Not nullable. |
| createdDateTime | DateTimeOffset | The date and time the application was registered. The DateTimeOffset type represents date and time information using ISO 8601 format and is always in UTC time. For example, midnight UTC on Jan 1, 2014 is `2014-01-01T00:00:00Z`. Read-only. <br><br> Supports `$filter` (`eq`, `ne`, `NOT`, `ge`, `le`, `in`) and `$orderBy`. |
| deletedDateTime | DateTimeOffset | The date and time the application was deleted. The DateTimeOffset type represents date and time information using ISO 8601 format and is always in UTC time. For example, midnight UTC on Jan 1, 2014 is `2014-01-01T00:00:00Z`. Read-only. |
| description | String | An optional description of the application. Supports `$filter` (`eq`, `ne`, `NOT`, `ge`, `le`, `startsWith`) and `$search`. |
| disabledByMicrosoftStatus | String | Specifies whether Microsoft has disabled the registered application. Possible values are: `null` (default value), `NotDisabled`, and `DisabledDueToViolationOfServicesAgreement` (reasons may include suspicious, abusive, or malicious activity, or a violation of the Microsoft Services Agreement). <br><br> Supports `$filter` (`eq`, `ne`, `NOT`). |
| displayName | String | The display name for the application. Supports `$filter` (`eq`, `ne`, `NOT`, `ge`, `le`, `in`, `startsWith`), `$search`, and `$orderBy`. |
| groupMembershipClaims | String | Configures the `groups` claim issued in a user or OAuth 2.0 access token that the application expects. To set this attribute, use one of the following valid string values: `None`, `SecurityGroup` (for security groups and Azure AD roles), `All` (this gets all of the security groups, distribution groups, and Azure AD directory roles that the signed-in user is a member of). |
| id | String | The unique identifier for the application. Inherited from [directoryObject](directoryobject.md). Key. Not nullable. Read-only. Supports `$filter` (`eq`, `ne`, `NOT`, `in`).|
| identifierUris | String collection | The URIs that identify the application within its Azure AD tenant, or within a verified custom domain if the application is multi-tenant. For more information see [Application Objects and Service Principal Objects](/azure/active-directory/develop/app-objects-and-service-principals). The `any` operator is required for filter expressions on multi-valued properties. Not nullable. <br><br>Supports `$filter` (`eq`, `ne`, `ge`, `le`, `startsWith`). |
| info | [informationalUrl](informationalurl.md) | Basic profile information of the application such as  app's marketing, support, terms of service and privacy statement URLs. The terms of service and privacy statement are surfaced to users through the user consent experience. For more info, see How to: [Add Terms of service and privacy statement for registered Azure AD apps](/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-add-terms-of-service-privacy-statement). <br><br>Supports `$filter` (`eq`, `ne`, `NOT`, `ge`, `le`). |
| isDeviceOnlyAuthSupported | Boolean | Specifies whether this application supports device authentication without a user. The default is `false`.  |
| isFallbackPublicClient | Boolean | Specifies the fallback application type as public client, such as an installed application running on a mobile device. The default value is `false` which means the fallback application type is confidential client such as a web app. There are certain scenarios where Azure AD cannot determine the client application type. For example, the [ROPC](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.3) flow where it is configured without specifying a redirect URI. In those cases Azure AD interprets the application type based on the value of this property.|
| keyCredentials | [keyCredential](keycredential.md) collection | The collection of key credentials associated with the application. Not nullable. Supports `$filter` (`eq`, `NOT`, `ge`, `le`). |
| logo | Stream | The main logo for the application. Not nullable. |
| notes | String | Notes relevant for the management of the application. |

| requiredResourceAccess |[requiredResourceAccess](requiredresourceaccess.md) collection|Specifies the resources that the application needs to access. This property also specifies the set of OAuth permission scopes and application roles that it needs for each of those resources. This configuration of access to the required resources drives the consent experience. Not nullable. <br><br>Supports `$filter` (`eq`, `NOT`, `ge`, `le`).|
| signInAudience | String | Specifies the Microsoft accounts that are supported for the current application. The possible values are: `AzureADMyOrg`, `AzureADMultipleOrgs`, `AzureADandPersonalMicrosoftAccount` (default), and `PersonalMicrosoftAccount`.
