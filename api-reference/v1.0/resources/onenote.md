# onenote resource type

The entry point for OneNote resources.

All calls to the OneNote service through the Microsoft Graph API use this service root URL:

```
https://graph.microsoft.com/{version}/{location}/onenote/ 
```

The location can be user notebooks on Office 365 or consumer OneDrive, and group notebooks on Office 365. SharePoint site-hosted notebooks is currently not supported. 

**User notebooks** To access personal notebooks on consumer OneDrive or OneDrive for Business, use one of the following URLs:

```
https://graph.microsoft.com/{version}/me/onenote/{notebooks | sections | sectionGroups | pages} 
https://graph.microsoft.com/{version}/users/{userPrincipalName}/onenote/{notebooks | sections | sectionGroups | pages} 
https://graph.microsoft.com/{version}/users/{id}/onenote/{notebooks | sections | sectionGroups | pages} 
```

**Group notebooks** To access notebooks that are owned by a group, use the following service root URL:

```
https://graph.microsoft.com/{version}/groups/{id}/onenote/{notebooks | sections | sectionGroups | pages} 
```

The following permission scopes provide levels of access to OneNote notebooks. Choosing permission scopes depends both on the location of the notebooks you're targeting and your app's functionality. 

**Scopes for personal notebooks in consumer OneDrive or OneDrive for Business that are owned by the current user**

| Scope | Permission in Azure portal | Description |
|:-------|:------|:------|

**Scopes for personal notebooks shared by other users and group notebooks that the current user can access**
