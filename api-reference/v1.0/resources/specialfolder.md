# specialFolder resource type

The **specialFolder** resource indiciates that an item is also available through the special folder collection.

Special folders provide simple aliases to access well-known folders in OneDrive without the need to look up the folder by path (which would require localization), or reference the folder with an ID. If a special folder is renamed or moved to another location within the drive, this syntax will continue to find that folder.

Special folders are automatically created the first time an application attempts to write to one, if it doesn't already exist. If a user deletes one, it is recreated when written to again.

**Note: **If you have read-only permissions and request a special folder that doesn't exist, you'll receive a `403 Forbidden` error.

The special folders that are available to all clients are: Documents, Photos, Camera Roll, App Root, and Music.
