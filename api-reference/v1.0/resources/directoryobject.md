|:---------------|:--------|:----------|
|[Get directory object](../api/directoryobject-get.md) | [directoryObject](directoryobject.md) |Read the properties of a directory object.|
|[Get delta for directory object](../api/directoryobject-delta.md)|[directoryObject](directoryObject.md) collection| Get incremental changes for directory objects such as [users](../api/user-delta.md), [groups](../api/group-delta.md), [applications](../api/application-delta.md), and [service principals](../api/serviceprincipal-delta.md). Filtering is required on either the **id** of the derived type or the derived type itself. For more information on delta queries, see the [Use delta query to track changes in Microsoft Graph data](/graph/delta-query-overview).|
|[Delete directory object](../api/directoryobject-delete.md) | None |Delete a directory object. |
|[Get available extension properties](../api/directoryobject-getavailableextensionproperties.md)|[extensionProperty](../resources/extensionproperty.md) collection|Get all or a filtered list of the directory extension properties that have been registered in a directory.|
|[Check member groups](../api/directoryobject-checkmembergroups.md)|String collection|Check for membership in a specified list of groups, and return from that list those groups of which the specified user, group, service principal, organizational contact, device, or directory object is a member. The check is transitive.|
|[Get member groups](../api/directoryobject-getmembergroups.md)|String collection|Return all groups that the user, group, service principal, organizational contact, device, or directory object is a member of. The check is transitive.|
|[Check member objects](../api/directoryobject-checkmemberobjects.md)|String collection|Check for membership in a list of group, administrative units, or directory roles for the specified user, group, device, organizational contact, or directory object. This method is transitive.|
|[Get member objects](../api/directoryobject-getmemberobjects.md)|String collection| Return all groups, administrative units, and directory roles that the user, group, device, organizational contact, or directory object is a member of. The check is transitive. |
|[Get objects by IDs](../api/directoryobject-getbyids.md) | [directoryObject](directoryobject.md) collection | Get a set of directory objects based on a set of supplied ids. |
|[Validate properties](../api/directoryobject-validateproperties.md)|JSON| Validate that a Microsoft 365 group's display name or mail nickname complies with naming policies. |

## Properties

| Property   | Type |Description|
|:---------------|:--------|:----------|
|deletedDateTime|DateTimeOffset|Date and time when this object was deleted. Always `null` when the object hasn't been deleted. |
|id|String|The unique identifier for the object. For example, `12345678-9abc-def0-1234-56789abcde`. The value of the **id** property is often but not exclusively in the form of a GUID; treat it as an opaque identifier and do not rely on it being a GUID. Key. Not nullable. Read-only. Inherited from [entity](entity.md).|
