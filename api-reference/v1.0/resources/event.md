# event resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

An event in a [user](user.md) calendar, or the default calendar of a Microsoft 365 [group](group.md).

The maximum number of attendees included in an **event**, and the maximum number of recipients in an [eventMessage](eventmessage.md) sent from an Exchange Online mailbox is 500. For more information, see [sending limits](/office365/servicedescriptions/exchange-online-service-description/exchange-online-limits#sending-limits).

This resource supports:

- Adding your own data to custom properties as [extensions](/graph/extensibility-overview).
- Subscribing to [change notifications](/graph/webhooks).
- Using [delta query](/graph/delta-query-overview) to track incremental additions, deletions, and updates, by providing a [delta](../api/event-delta.md) function.

> **Note:** There are a few minor differences in the way you can interact with user calendars, group calendars, and their events:

- You can organize only user calendars in a [calendarGroup](calendargroup.md).
- You can add [attachment](attachment.md) objects to events in only user calendars, but not to events in group calendars.
- Outlook automatically accepts all meeting requests on behalf of groups. You can [accept](../api/event-accept.md), [tentatively accept](../api/event-tentativelyaccept.md), or [decline](../api/event-decline.md)  meeting requests for _user_ calendars only.
- Outlook doesn't support reminders for group events. You can [snooze](../api/event-snoozereminder.md) or [dismiss](../api/event-dismissreminder.md) a [reminder](reminder.md) for _user_ calendars only.

## Properties
| Property     | Type |Description|
|:---------------|:--------|:----------|
|allowNewTimeProposals| Boolean | `true` if the meeting organizer allows invitees to propose a new time when responding; otherwise, `false`. Optional. Default is `true`. |
|attendees|[Attendee](attendee.md) collection|The collection of attendees for the event.|

|categories|String collection|The categories associated with the event. Each category corresponds to the **displayName** property of an [outlookCategory](outlookcategory.md) defined for the user.|
|changeKey|String|Identifies the version of the event object. Every time the event is changed, ChangeKey changes as well. This allows Exchange to apply changes to the correct version of the object.|
|createdDateTime|DateTimeOffset|The Timestamp type represents date and time information using ISO 8601 format and is always in UTC time. For example, midnight UTC on Jan 1, 2014 is `2014-01-01T00:00:00Z`|
|end|[DateTimeTimeZone](datetimetimezone.md)|The date, time, and time zone that the event ends. By default, the end time is in UTC.|
|hasAttachments|Boolean|Set to true if the event has attachments.|
|hideAttendees|Boolean|When set to `true`, each attendee only sees themselves in the meeting request and meeting **Tracking** list. Default is false.|
|iCalUId|String|A unique identifier for an event across calendars. This ID is different for each occurrence in a recurring series. Read-only.|
|id|String| Unique identifier for the event. [!INCLUDE [outlook-beta-id](../../includes/outlook-immutable-id.md)] Case-sensitive and read-only.|
|importance|String|The importance of the event. The possible values are: `low`, `normal`, `high`.|

|isCancelled|Boolean|Set to true if the event has been canceled.|
|isDraft|Boolean|Set to true if the user has updated the meeting in Outlook but has not sent the updates to attendees. Set to false if all changes have been sent, or if the event is an appointment without any attendees.|
|isOnlineMeeting|Boolean| `True` if this event has online meeting information (that is, **onlineMeeting** points to an [onlineMeetingInfo](onlinemeetinginfo.md) resource), `false` otherwise. Default is `false` (**onlineMeeting** is `null`). Optional. <br> After you set **isOnlineMeeting** to `true`, Microsoft Graph initializes **onlineMeeting**. Subsequently Outlook ignores any further changes to **isOnlineMeeting**, and the meeting remains available online. |
|isOrganizer|Boolean|Set to true if the calendar owner (specified by the **owner** property of the [calendar](calendar.md)) is the organizer of the event (specified by the **organizer** property of the **event**). This also applies if a delegate organized the event on behalf of the owner.|
|isReminderOn|Boolean|Set to true if an alert is set to remind the user of the event.|
|lastModifiedDateTime|DateTimeOffset|The Timestamp type represents date and time information using ISO 8601 format and is always in UTC time. For example, midnight UTC on Jan 1, 2014 is `2014-01-01T00:00:00Z`|

|onlineMeeting|[OnlineMeetingInfo](onlinemeetinginfo.md)| Details for an attendee to join the meeting online. Default is null. Read-only. <br>After you set the **isOnlineMeeting** and **onlineMeetingProvider** properties to enable a meeting online, Microsoft Graph initializes **onlineMeeting**. When set, the meeting remains available online, and you cannot change the **isOnlineMeeting**, **onlineMeetingProvider**, and **onlneMeeting** properties again.|
|onlineMeetingProvider|onlineMeetingProviderType| Represents the online meeting service provider. By default, **onlineMeetingProvider** is `unknown`. The possible values are `unknown`, `teamsForBusiness`, `skypeForBusiness`, and `skypeForConsumer`. Optional. <br> After you set **onlineMeetingProvider**, Microsoft Graph initializes **onlineMeeting**. Subsequently you cannot change **onlineMeetingProvider** again, and the meeting remains available online. |
|onlineMeetingUrl|String|A URL for an online meeting. The property is set only when an organizer specifies in Outlook that an event is an online meeting such as Skype. Read-only.<br>To access the URL to join an online meeting, use **joinUrl** which is exposed via the **onlineMeeting** property of the **event**.

|start|[DateTimeTimeZone](datetimetimezone.md)|The start date, time, and time zone of the event. By default, the start time is in UTC.|
|subject|String|The text of the event's subject line.|
|transactionId|String|A custom identifier specified by a client app for the server to avoid redundant [POST](../api/calendar-post-events.md) operations in case of client retries to create the same event. This is useful when low network connectivity causes the client to time out before receiving a response from the server for the client's prior create-event request. After you set **transactionId** when creating an event, you cannot change **transactionId** in a subsequent update. This property is only returned in a response payload if an app has set it. Optional.|

|webLink|String|The URL to open the event in Outlook on the web.<br/><br/>Outlook on the web opens the event in the browser if you are signed in to your mailbox. Otherwise, Outlook on the web prompts you to sign in.<br/><br/>This URL cannot be accessed from within an iFrame.|

> [!NOTE]
> The **webLink** property specifies a URL that opens the event in only earlier versions of Outlook on the web. The following is its URL format, with _{event-id}_ being the _**URL-encoded**_ value of the **id** property:

> `https://outlook.office365.com/calendar/item/{event-id}`
>
> * For Microsoft accounts:
>  `https://outlook.live.com/calendar/item/{event-id}`
