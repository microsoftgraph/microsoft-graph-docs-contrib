# changeNotificationEncryptedContent resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Represents the encrypted data attached to a change notification.

For more information, see [Set up change notifications that include resource data (preview)](/graph/webhooks-with-resource-data.md).

## Properties

| Property | Type | Description |
|:---------|:-----|:------------|
| data | string | Base64-encoded encrypted data that produces a full resource respresented as JSON. The data has been encrypted with the provided `dataKey` using an `AES/CBC/PKCS5PADDING` cipher suite. |
| dataSignature | string | Base64-encoded HMAC-SHA256 hash of the data for validation purposes. |
| dataKey | string | Base64-encoded symmetric key generated by Microsoft Graph to encrypt the data value and to generate the data signature. This key is encrypted with the certificate public key that was provided during the subscription. It must be decrypted with the certificate private key before it can be used to decrypt the data or verify the signature. This key has been encrypted with the following cipher suite: `RSA/ECB/OAEPWithSHA1AndMGF1Padding`. |
| encryptionCertificateId | string | ID of the certificate used to encrypt the `dataKey`. |
| encryptionCertificateThumbprint | string | Hexadecimal representation of the thumbprint of the certificate used to encrypt the `dataKey`. |
