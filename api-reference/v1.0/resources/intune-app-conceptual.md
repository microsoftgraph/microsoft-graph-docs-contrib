# Manage apps using Microsoft Intune

Namespace: microsoft.graph

> **Note:** Using the Microsoft Graph APIs to configure Intune controls and policies still requires that the Intune service is [correctly licensed](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/cloud-platform/microsoft-intune-pricing) by the customer.

Use Graph resources to manage apps in Intune. See the table of content for a list of resources.
