# host resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph.security

[!INCLUDE [threatintelligence-api-disclaimer](../../includes/threatintelligence-api-disclaimer.md)]

Represents a [hostname](../resources/security-hostname.md) or [IP address](../resources/security-ipaddress.md) that is currently or was previously available on the internet and Microsoft Defender Threat Intelligence has detected.

This is an abstract type. Implementations of this type include:

- [hostname](../resources/security-hostname.md)
- [ipAddress](../resources/security-ipaddress.md)

Inherits from [artifact](../resources/security-artifact.md).
