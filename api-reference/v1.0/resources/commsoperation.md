# commsOperation resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Represents the status of certain long-running operations.

This resource can be returned as the response to an action, or as the content of a [commsNotification](commsNotification.md).  

When it is returned as a response to an action, the status indicates whether there will be subsequent notifications. If, for example, an operation with status of `completed` or `failed` is returned,  there will not be any subsequent operation via the notification channel. 

If a `null` operation, or an operation with a status of `notStarted` or `running` is returned, subsequent updates will come via the notification channel.
