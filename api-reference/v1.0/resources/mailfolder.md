# mailFolder resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph

A mail folder in a user's mailbox, such as Inbox and Drafts. Mail folders can contain messages, other Outlook items, and child mail folders.

This resource supports using [delta query](/graph/delta-query-overview) to track incremental additions, deletions, and updates,
by providing a [delta](../api/mailfolder-delta.md) function.

**Well-known folder names**

Outlook creates certain folders for users by default. Instead of using the corresponding folder **id** value, for convenience, you can use
the well-known folder names from the table below when accessing these folders. For example, you can get the Drafts folder using its well-known name with the following query.

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
GET /me/mailFolders/drafts
```

Well-known names work regardless of the locale of the user's mailbox, so the above query will always return the user's Drafts folder regardless of how it's named.

| Well-known folder name | Description |
|:-----------------------|:------------|
| archive | The archive folder messages are sent to when using the One_Click Archive feature in Outlook clients that support it. **Note:** This isn't the same as the Archive Mailbox feature of Exchange online. |
| clutter | The clutter folder low-priority messages are moved to when using the Clutter feature. |
| conflicts | The folder that contains conflicting items in the mailbox. |
| conversationhistory | The folder where Skype saves IM conversations (if Skype is configured to do so). |
| deleteditems | The folder items are moved to when they're deleted. |
| drafts | The folder that contains unsent messages. |
| inbox | The inbox folder. |
| junkemail | The junk email folder. |
| localfailures | The folder that contains items that exist on the local client but couldn't be uploaded to the server. |
| msgfolderroot | The "Top of Information Store" folder. This folder is the parent folder for folders that are displayed in normal mail clients, such as the inbox. |
| outbox | The outbox folder. |
| recoverableitemsdeletions | The folder that contains soft-deleted items: deleted either from the Deleted Items folder, or by pressing shift+delete in Outlook. This folder isn't visible in any Outlook email client, but end users can interact with it through the **Recover Deleted Items from Server** feature in Outlook or Outlook on the web. |
| scheduled | The folder that contains messages that are scheduled to reappear in the inbox using the Schedule feature in Outlook for iOS. |
| searchfolders | The parent folder for all search folders defined in the user's mailbox. |
| sentitems | The sent items folder. |
| serverfailures | The folder that contains items that exist on the server but couldn't be synchronized to the local client. |
| syncissues | The folder that contains synchronization logs created by Outlook. |

## Properties

| Property | Type | Description |
|:---------|:-----|:------------|
|childFolderCount|Int32|The number of immediate child mailFolders in the current mailFolder.|
|displayName|String|The mailFolder's display name.|
|id|String|The mailFolder's unique identifier.|
|isHidden|Boolean|Indicates whether the mailFolder is hidden. This property can be set only when creating the folder. Find more information in [Hidden mail folders](#hidden-mail-folders).|
|parentFolderId|String|The unique identifier for the mailFolder's parent mailFolder.|
|totalItemCount|Int32|The number of items in the mailFolder.|
|unreadItemCount|Int32|The number of items in the mailFolder marked as unread.|

**Access item counts efficiently**

The `TotalItemCount` and `UnreadItemCount` properties of a folder allow you to conveniently compute the number of read items in the folder.
They let you avoid queries like the following that can incur significant latency:

```http
https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me/mailFolders/inbox/messages?$count=true&$filter=isread%20eq%20false
```

Mail folders in Outlook can contain more than one type of items, for example, the Inbox can contain meeting request items that are distinct from mail items. `TotalItemCount` and `UnreadItemCount` include items in a mail folder irrespective of their item types.

### Hidden mail folders
The default value of the `isHidden` property is `false`. You can set **isHidden** only once when [creating the mailFolder](../api/user-post-mailfolders.md). You can't update the property using a PATCH operation. To change the **isHidden** property of a folder, delete the existing folder and create a new one with the desired value.

Hidden mail folders support all operations that are supported by a regular mail folder.

By default, [listing mailFolders](../api/user-list-mailfolders.md) returns only mail folders that aren't hidden. To include hidden mail folders in the response, use the query parameter `includeHiddenFolders=true`. Then use the **isHidden** property to identify whether a mail folder is hidden.

## Relationships

| Relationship | Type | Description |
|:-------------|:-----|:------------|
|childFolders|[MailFolder](mailfolder.md) collection|The collection of child folders in the mailFolder.|
|messageRules | [messageRule](messagerule.md) collection | The collection of rules that apply to the user's Inbox folder. |
|messages|[Message](message.md) collection|The collection of messages in the mailFolder.|
|multiValueExtendedProperties|[multiValueLegacyExtendedProperty](multivaluelegacyextendedproperty.md) collection| The collection of multi-value extended properties defined for the mailFolder. Read-only. Nullable.|
|singleValueExtendedProperties|[singleValueLegacyExtendedProperty](singlevaluelegacyextendedproperty.md) collection| The collection of single-value extended properties defined for the mailFolder. Read-only. Nullable.|
