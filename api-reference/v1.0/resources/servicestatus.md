### backupServiceStatus values

|Member | Description |
|:------|:------------|
|disabled | Service is disabled. This is the default state. The service isn't enabled for the tenant.|
|enabled | Service is enabled. A new protection policy can be created or modified and restore is allowed.|
|protectionChangeLocked | Service is locked with no change in protection allowed. A new protection policy can't be created or updated. No new protection items can be added or removed.|

|unknownFutureValue | Evolvable enumeration sentinel value. Don't use.|

#### protectionChangeLocked

A service is locked with no change in protection allowed in the following scenarios:

- The tenant has no active service apps. If no active service apps are found for the tenant, the feature status of the tenant changes from `enabled` to `protectionChangeLocked`. To resolve this issue, the tenant needs to activate a service app and call the [enable](../api/backuprestoreroot-enable.md) API.
- The tenant has an unhealthy billing profile. When an unhealthy billing profile is found for a tenant, the feature status is automatically moved from `enabled` to `protectionChangeLocked`, and the policies are deactivated right away. To resolve this issue, the tenant needs to update the billing profile with a healthy one and wait for 24-48 hours for the changes to take effect.

#### restoreLocked

When a tenant stays in the `protectionChangeLocked` status for 30 days, the status changes from `protectionChangeLocked` to `restoreLocked`. With this change, restore capabilities are blocked, and billing also stops. To resolve this issue, the tenant needs to follow the steps to resolve the issue based on the scenarios described in [protectionChangeLocked](#protectionchangelocked).
