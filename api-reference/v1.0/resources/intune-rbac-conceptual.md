# Role-based access control in Microsoft Intune

Namespace: microsoft.graph

> **Note:** Using the Microsoft Graph APIs to configure Intune controls and policies still requires that the Intune service is [correctly licensed](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/cloud-platform/microsoft-intune-pricing) by the customer.

Intune's role-based access control determines who can perform actions on Intune objects and make changes for managed applications, users and devices.   

Use Graph resources to manage role-based access in Intune. See the table of content for a list of resources.
