# accessReviewInstance resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Represents an Azure AD [access review](accessreviewsv2-root.md) recurrence. System-generated based off of the parent [accessReviewScheduleDefinition](accessreviewscheduledefinition.md). All properties are read-only.

If the instance is a part of a recurring access review, instances represent each recurrence. A review that does not recur will have exactly one instance. Instances also represent each unique resource being reviewed in the schedule definition. If a schedule definition reviews multiple resources, each resource will have a unique instance for each recurrence.

Every **accessReviewInstance** contains a list of [decisions](accessreviewinstancedecisionitem.md) that reviewers can take action on. There is one decision per identity being reviewed.

Inherits from [entity](../resources/entity.md).
