# accessReviewInstance resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Represents a Microsoft Entra [access review](accessreviewsv2-overview.md) recurrence. If the parent [accessReviewScheduleDefinition](accessreviewscheduledefinition.md) is a recurring access review, instances represent each recurrence. A review that does not recur will have exactly one instance. Instances also represent each unique group being reviewed in the schedule definition. If a schedule definition reviews multiple groups, each group will have a unique instance for each recurrence.

Every **accessReviewInstance** contains a list of [decisions](accessreviewinstancedecisionitem.md) that reviewers can take action on. There is one decision per identity being reviewed.

Inherits from [entity](../resources/entity.md).

| Property | Type | Description |
| :-------------------------| :---------------------------------- | :---------- |
| endDateTime | DateTimeOffset | DateTime when review instance is scheduled to end.The DatetimeOffset type represents date and time information using ISO 8601 format and is always in UTC time. For example, midnight UTC on Jan 1, 2014 is `2014-01-01T00:00:00Z`. Supports `$select`. Read-only.|

Supports `$select`.|
| id | String | Unique identifier of the instance. Supports `$select`. Read-only.|
| reviewers   |[accessReviewReviewerScope](../resources/accessreviewreviewerscope.md) collection| This collection of access review scopes is used to define who the reviewers are. Supports `$select`. For examples of options for assigning reviewers, see [Assign reviewers to your access review definition using the Microsoft Graph API](/graph/accessreviews-scope-concept).|
| scope | [accessReviewScope](accessreviewscope.md) | Created based on **scope** and **instanceEnumerationScope** at the accessReviewScheduleDefinition level. Defines the scope of users reviewed in a group. Supports `$select` and `$filter` (`contains` only). Read-only. |
| startDateTime | DateTimeOffset | DateTime when review instance is scheduled to start. May be in the future. The DateTimeOffset type represents date and time information using ISO 8601 format and is always in UTC time. For example, midnight UTC on Jan 1, 2014 is `2014-01-01T00:00:00Z`. Supports `$select`.

## Relationships

| Relationship | Type    |Description|
|:---------------|:--------|:----------|
| contactedReviewers   |[accessReviewReviewer](../resources/accessreviewreviewer.md) collection| Returns the collection of reviewers who were contacted to complete this review. While the **reviewers** and **fallbackReviewers** properties of the **accessReviewScheduleDefinition** might specify group owners or managers as **reviewers**, **contactedReviewers** returns their individual identities. Supports `$select`. Read-only. |
| decisions               |[accessReviewInstanceDecisionItem](accessreviewinstancedecisionitem.md) collection        | Each user reviewed in an **accessReviewInstance** has a decision item representing if they were approved, denied, or not yet reviewed. |
| stages|[accessReviewStage](accessreviewstage.md) collection| If the instance has multiple stages, this returns the collection of stages. A new stage will only be created when the previous stage ends. The existence, number, and settings of stages on a review instance are created based on the [accessReviewStageSettings](accessreviewstagesettings.md) on the parent [accessReviewScheduleDefinition](accessreviewscheduledefinition.md). |
