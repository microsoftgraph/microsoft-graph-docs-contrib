# Use the Microsoft Search API to manage administrative answers

You can use Microsoft Graph to [manage administrative search answer results](/graph/search-concept-answers) in the [Microsoft Search](/microsoftsearch/overview-microsoft-search) experience.

Requests to manage administrative search answers are performed by users with administrator roles, such as Search Administrators and Search Editors, or are performed on behalf of an application without the presence of a signed-in user, identified using an [access token with application permission](/graph/auth-v2-service).

## Common use cases

The use cases for the APIs in this section involve managing administrative answers such as acronyms, bookmarks, and QnAs for an organization.

| Use cases                                        | REST resources                              |
|:-------------------------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------|
| **Search answer actions**                        |                                             |
| Create, update, or delete a search answer        | [acronym](search-acronym.md), [bookmark](search-bookmark.md), [qna](search-qna.md) |

## Supported language tags
A language tag of a [bookmark](search-bookmark.md) or [qna](search-qna.md) represents a geographically specific language in which that search answer (**bookmark** or **qna**) can be viewed. A language tag follows the pattern {language}-{region}. For information on the supported values for {language} and {region}, see [RFC 4646](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4646).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You must specify values for {language} and {region} in lower case.

The following table lists the language tags, locales, and the corresponding country or region that you can set in the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com/) to publish a search answer. The **Locale** column describes the language as used in that country or region.
