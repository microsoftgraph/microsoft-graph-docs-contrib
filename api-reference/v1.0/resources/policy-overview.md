# Azure AD policy overview

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) uses policies to control Azure AD feature behaviors in your organization. Policies are custom rules that you can enforce on applications, service principals, groups, or on the entire organization they are assigned to.

## What policies are available?

| Policy type       | Description | Examples |
|:-------------|:------------|:------------|
|[activityBasedTimeoutPolicies](activityBasedTimeoutPolicy.md)| Represents a policy that controls automatic sign-out for web sessions after a period of inactivity, for applications that support activity-based timeout functionality.| Configure the Azure portal to have an inactivity timeout of 15 minutes. |
|[authenticationFlowsPolicies](authenticationflowspolicy.md)| Represents a policy that controls whether external users should be able to sign up and gain a guest account via an External Identities self-service sign-up user flow.| Enable your applications to support external users signing up via a self-service sign-up user flow. |
|[claimsMappingPolicies](claimsMappingPolicy.md)| Represents the claim-mapping policies for WS-Fed, SAML, OAuth 2.0, and OpenID Connect protocols, for tokens issued to a specific application. | Create and assign a policy to omit the basic claims from tokens issued to a service principal. |
|[homeRealmDiscoveryPolicies](homeRealmDiscoveryPolicy.md)| Represents a policy to control Azure Active Directory authentication behavior for federated users, in particular for auto-acceleration and user authentication restrictions in federated domains.| Configure all users to skip home realm discovery and be routed directly to ADFS for authentication. |
|[tokenLifetimePolicies](tokenlifetimepolicy.md)|Represents the lifetime duration of access tokens used to access protected resources.| Configure a particularly sensitive application with a shorter than default token lifetime.|
|[tokenIssuancePolicy](tokenIssuancePolicy.md)|Represents the policy to specify the characteristics of SAML tokens issued by Azure AD.| Configure the signing algorithm or SAML token version to be used to issue the SAML token.
|[identitySecurityDefaultsEnforcementPolicy](identitysecuritydefaultsenforcementpolicy.md)|Represents the Azure AD security defaults policy.| Configure the Azure AD security defaults policy to protect against common attacks.
