> [!NOTE]
> SharePoint Embedded requires the `FileStorageContainer.Selected` permission to access the content of the container. This permission is different from the ones mentioned previously. In addition to Microsoft Graph permissions, your app must have the necessary [container type permissions](/sharepoint/dev/embedded/development/auth#container-type-application-permissions) to call this API. For more information, see [SharePoint Embedded authentication and authorization](/sharepoint/dev/embedded/concepts/app-concepts/auth).
