<!-- Applies to eDiscovery custodian APIs -->

> [!TIP]
> In delegated scenarios with work or school accounts, the signed-in user must be assigned a supported [Microsoft Purview role](/purview/edisc-permissions) through one of the following options:
> 
> - **eDiscovery Manager**. This role allows members to manage custodians and data sources for eDiscovery cases they create. However, eDiscovery Managers can only manage custodians for the cases they create. **This is the least privileged option for managing custodians in their own cases**.
> - **eDiscovery Administrator**. This role provides all the permissions of eDiscovery Manager, plus the ability to manage custodians and data sources for all eDiscovery cases in the organization.
> 
> The Custodian role provides access to manage data sources (mailboxes, SharePoint sites, and Teams) associated with custodians in eDiscovery cases. This role is only available to members of the eDiscovery Manager role group.
