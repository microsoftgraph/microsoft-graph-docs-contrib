> In delegated scenarios with work or school accounts, the signed-in user must be assigned a supported [Microsoft Entra role](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference?toc=%2Fgraph%2Ftoc.json) or a custom role with a supported role permission. *Application Administrator* is the least privileged role supported for this operation. *Cloud Application Administrator* can't manage app proxy settings.
