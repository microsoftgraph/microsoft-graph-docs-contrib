> [!TIP]
> In delegated scenarios with work or school accounts, the signed-in user must also be assigned an administrator role with supported role permissions through the following option:
> 
> - A [Microsoft Entra role](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference?toc=%2Fgraph%2Ftoc.json) where the least privileged role is *Identity Governance Administrator*. **This is the least privileged option.**
> 
> In app-only scenarios, the calling app can be assigned one of the preceding supported roles instead of the `EntitlementManagement.ReadWrite.All` application permission. The *Identity Governance Administrator* role is less privileged than the `EntitlementManagement.ReadWrite.All` application permission.
> 
> For more information, see [Delegation and roles in entitlement management](/entra/id-governance/entitlement-management-delegate) and [how to delegate access governance to access package managers in entitlement management](/entra/id-governance/entitlement-management-delegate-managers).
