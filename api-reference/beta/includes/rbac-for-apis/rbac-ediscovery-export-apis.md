<!-- Applies to eDiscovery export APIs -->

> [!TIP]
> In delegated scenarios with work or school accounts, the signed-in user must be assigned a supported [Microsoft Purview role](/purview/edisc-permissions) through one of the following options:
> 
> - **eDiscovery Manager**. This role allows members to export search results and review set data from eDiscovery cases they create. However, eDiscovery Managers can only export data from the cases they create. **This is the least privileged option for exporting data from their own cases**.
> - **eDiscovery Administrator**. This role provides all the permissions of eDiscovery Manager, plus the ability to export data from all eDiscovery cases in the organization.
> 
> The Export role is required to export search results to a local computer and prepare search results for analysis. This role is only available to members of the eDiscovery Manager role group.
