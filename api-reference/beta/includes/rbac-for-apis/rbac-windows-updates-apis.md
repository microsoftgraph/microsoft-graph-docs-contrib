> In delegated scenarios with work or school accounts, the signed-in user must be an owner or member of the group or be assigned a supported [Microsoft Entra role](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference?toc=%2Fgraph%2Ftoc.json) or a custom role with a supported role permission. *Intune Administrator*, or *Windows Update Deployment Administrator* are the least privileged roles supported for this operation.
