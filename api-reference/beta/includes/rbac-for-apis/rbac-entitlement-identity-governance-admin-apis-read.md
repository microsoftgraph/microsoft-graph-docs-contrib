> In delegated scenarios with work or school accounts, the signed-in user must also be assigned an administrator role with supported role permissions through one of the following options:
> 
> - A [Microsoft Entra role](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference?toc=%2Fgraph%2Ftoc.json) where the least privileged role is *Identity Governance Administrator*. **This is the least privileged option.**
