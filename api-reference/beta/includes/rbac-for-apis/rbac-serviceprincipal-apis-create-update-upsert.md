> In delegated scenarios with work or school accounts, the admin must be assigned a supported [Microsoft Entra role](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference?toc=%2Fgraph%2Ftoc.json) or a custom role with a supported role permission. The following least privileged roles are supported for this operation.
> 
> - For multitenant apps:
>   - Application Administrator
>   - Cloud Application Administrator
> - For single-tenant apps where the calling user is a nonadmin user but is the owner of the backing application, the user must have the *Application Developer* role.
