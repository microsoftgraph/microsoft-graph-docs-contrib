<!-- Applies to eDiscovery tag management APIs -->

> [!TIP]
> In delegated scenarios with work or school accounts, the signed-in user must be assigned a supported [Microsoft Purview role](/purview/edisc-permissions) through one of the following options:
> 
> - **eDiscovery Manager**. This role allows members to manage tags in review sets for eDiscovery cases they create. However, eDiscovery Managers can only manage tags in the cases they create. **This is the least privileged option for managing tags in their own cases**.
> - **eDiscovery Administrator**. This role provides all the permissions of eDiscovery Manager, plus the ability to manage tags in all eDiscovery cases in the organization.
> - **Reviewer**. This role provides read-only access to review sets and can view tags within eDiscovery cases where the user is a member.
> 
> The Manage review set tags role allows users to create, edit, and delete tags in review sets. This role combined with the Review role enables full tag management and review capabilities.
> 
> For more information about eDiscovery permissions and roles, see [Assign permissions in eDiscovery](/purview/edisc-permissions).
