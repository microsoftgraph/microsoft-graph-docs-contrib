# enumeratedPreApprovedPermissions resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph.enumeratedPreApprovedPermissions

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

This type is used in the conditions of a [permissionGrantPreApprovalPolicy](permissiongrantpreapprovalpolicy.md) to indicate that only the permissions explicitly included in the policy are allowed for consent. If the client application requests more permissions after the policy is created, the policy will not apply.

Inherits from [preApprovePermissions](../resources/preapprovedpermissions.md).

|permissionKind|permissionKind| Inherited from [preapprovedpermissions](../resources/preapprovedpermissions.md). Indicates the scope of permissions that are included in this condition set.
