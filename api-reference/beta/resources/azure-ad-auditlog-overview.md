# Audit logs API overview

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Microsoft Entra provides an audit trail of all user and app activity in your tenant to help you track all activities in your tenant and also be compliant. These logs include both app and user sign in activity, and changes to the directory.

[Microsoft Entra data retention policies](/entra/identity/monitoring-health/reference-reports-data-retention#how-long-does-azure-ad-store-the-data) governs the availability of these activity reports.

## What are activity reports?

Microsoft Entra provides four types of activity reports:

- Directory audit logs
- Custom security attribute audit logs
- Self-service sign-ups (Microsoft Entra External ID)
- Sign-ins
- Provisioning

## Available audit logs

### Directory audit logs

The [directory audit logs](../resources/directoryaudit.md) provide you with access to the history of every task performed in your tenant, either by a user or a service. Among others, the provided data enables you to address common scenarios such as:

- Who granted admin group access to a directory user?
- Which users are signing in to a recently acquired app?
- How many passwords resets were made within the directory?

### Custom security attribute audit logs

[Custom security attribute audit logs](../resources/customsecurityattributeaudit.md) provide you with the history of activities related to [custom security attributes](../resources/custom-security-attributes-overview.md), such as adding a new definition or assigning an attribute value to a user. Custom security attribute audit logs are separate from directory audit logs and have a different endpoint. To view custom security attribute audit logs, you must be assigned the Attribute Log Reader or Attribute Log Administrator role. By default, a Global Administrator doesn't have access to these audit logs.

### Self-service sign-ups (Microsoft Entra External ID)

The [sign-ups report](../resources/selfservicesignup.md) helps you see all the sign-up attempts (failed and successful) in Microsoft Entra External ID.

### Sign-ins

The [sign-in logs](../resources/signin.md) help you determine who or what performed the tasks reported by directory audit logs. The logs include interactive user sign-ins, non-interactive user sign-ins, service principal sign-ins, and managed identity sign-ins.

The sign-ins report helps you answer questions like:

- What is the sign in pattern of a user?
- How many users signed in the last week?
- What's the status of these sign-ins?

### Provisioning

The [provisioning logs](../resources/provisioningobjectsummary.md) help you see all the actions performed by the Microsoft Entra provisioning service. The provisioning report helps you answer questions like:

- What groups were successfully created in ServiceNow?
- What roles were imported from Amazon Web Services?
- What users were unsuccessfully created from Workday?

Activity reports are available for features that you've licensed. If you have a license for a specific feature, you also have access to the reports.
