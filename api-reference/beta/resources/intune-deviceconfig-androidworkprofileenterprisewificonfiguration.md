# androidWorkProfileEnterpriseWiFiConfiguration resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph

> **Important:** Microsoft Graph APIs under the /beta version are subject to change; production use is not supported.

> **Note:** The Microsoft Graph API for Intune requires an [active Intune license](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=839381) for the tenant.

By providing the configurations in this profile you can instruct the Android Work Profile device to connect to desired Wi-Fi endpoint. By specifying the authentication method and security types expected by Wi-Fi endpoint you can make the Wi-Fi connection seamless for end user.
