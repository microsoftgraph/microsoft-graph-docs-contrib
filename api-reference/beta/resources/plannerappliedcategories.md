# plannerAppliedCategories resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Represents the collection of categories (or labels) that have been applied to a task, which is part of the [plannerTask](plannertask.md) object.
Up to 25 categories can be applied to a task. Category descriptions are part of the [plan details](plannerplandetails.md) object. This is an open type.

## Properties
Properties of an open type can be defined by the client. In this case, the client must provide **category1**, **category2**, **category3**, **category4**, **category5**, and so on, up to **category25** as properties with their values being `true` when the corresponding categories are applied on the task. When they don't apply, properties are automatically removed by setting their values to `false`, as shown in the following example.

```json
{
  "category1": true,
  "category3": true,
  "category5": true,
  "category21": true
}
```

## Relationships
