# chatMessageMention resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Represents a mention in a [chatMessage](chatmessage.md) entity. The mention can be to a [user](user.md), [team](team.md), bot, or [channel](channel.md). 

In a **chatMessage** object that contains one or more mentions, the message body **content** property represents the chat message in HTML. It encloses the **mentionText** of each mention in an HTML `at` element, with an `id` attribute that corresponds to the **id** property of the mention.

As an example, a chat message contains two mentions, with the mention text "Megan" and "Alex" respectively. Its body **content** property specifies `at` elements for the two mentions as follows:

``` json
"body": {
    "contentType": "html",
    "content": "<div><div>Ah, <at id=\"0\">Megan</at>, <at id=\"1\">Alex</at>, I saw them in a separate folder. Thanks!</div>\n</div>"
}
```

In the **content** property, the first mention has an HTML `id` attribute of 0. This corresponds to the **id** property of that first instance of **chatMessageMention**, which is also 0.

The second mention has an `id` attribute of 1, matching the **id** property of the second instance, which is 1.

For a fuller context of the example, see [List channel message replies](../api/chatmessage-list-replies.md#example).
