# scopeSensitivityLabels resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Defines the sensitivity labels for groups that are included in a [permissionGrantPreApprovalPolicy](../resources/permissiongrantpreapprovalpolicy.md), or included or excluded in a [permission grant policy](permissiongrantpolicy.md). Since **chat** resources don't support sensitivity labels, use `all` when the **scopeType** of [preApprovalDetail](../resources/preapprovaldetail.md) is `chat`. For more information about sensitivity labels, see [sensitivity labels](/microsoft-365/compliance/sensitivity-labels).

This resource is an abstract base type from which the following types are derived:
* [allscopesensitivitylabels](allscopesensitivitylabels.md) indicates all sensitivity labels are preapproved
* [enumeratedscopesensitivitylabels](enumeratedscopesensitivitylabels.md) indicates that only the specified sensitivity labels are preapproved

## Properties
