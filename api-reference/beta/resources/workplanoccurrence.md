# workPlanOccurrence resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Represents a specific work schedule instance for a particular day or time period in your work plan.

Your work plan occurrences can be automatically generated from recurring work patterns or manually created for special arrangements. These occurrences are useful for handling exceptions to your regular schedules. Examples include:

- Working different hours for a specific day
- Working from a different location 
- Taking time off

When a work plan occurrence exists for the same time period as a recurring pattern, the occurrence takes precedence, allowing for flexible schedule adjustments.
