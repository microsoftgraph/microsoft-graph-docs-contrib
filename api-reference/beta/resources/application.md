# application resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Represents an application. Any application that outsources authentication to Microsoft Entra ID must be registered in the Microsoft identity platform. Application registration involves telling Microsoft Entra ID about your application, including the URL where it's located, the URL to send replies after authentication, the URI to identify your application, and more. 

Inherits from [directoryObject](directoryobject.md).

This resource is an open type that allows other properties to be passed in.

This resource supports:

- Adding your own data to custom properties as [extensions](/graph/extensibility-overview).
- Using [delta query](/graph/delta-query-overview) to track incremental additions, deletions, and updates, by providing a [delta](../api/user-delta.md) function.
- Alternate key syntax.  The `appId` property is a supported alternate key.  For more information, see [Get application](../api/application-get.md).

## Properties

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Specific usage of `$filter` and the `$search` query parameter is supported only when you use the **ConsistencyLevel** header set to `eventual` and `$count`. For more information, see [Advanced query capabilities on directory objects](/graph/aad-advanced-queries#application-properties).

| Property | Type | Description |
|:---------------|:--------|:----------|
| addIns | [addIn](addin.md) collection | Defines custom behavior that a consuming service can use to call an app in specific contexts. For example, applications that can render file streams [can set the addIns property](/onedrive/developer/file-handlers) for its "FileHandler" functionality. This lets services like Office 365 call the application in the context of a document the user is working on. |
| api | [apiApplication](apiapplication.md) | Specifies settings for an application that implements a web API. |
| appId | String | The unique identifier for the application that is assigned by Microsoft Entra ID. Not nullable. Read-only. Alternate key. Supports `$filter` (`eq`). |

|defaultRedirectUri|String|The default redirect URI. If specified and there's no explicit redirect URI in the sign-in request for SAML and OIDC flows, Microsoft Entra ID sends the token to this redirect URI. Microsoft Entra ID also sends the token to this default URI in SAML IdP-initiated single sign-on. The value must match one of the configured redirect URIs for the application.|
| deletedDateTime | DateTimeOffset | The date and time the application was deleted. The DateTimeOffset type represents date and time information using ISO 8601 format and is always in UTC time. For example, midnight UTC on Jan 1, 2014 is `2014-01-01T00:00:00Z`. Read-only. |

| displayName | String | The display name for the application. Maximum length is 256 characters. Supports `$filter` (`eq`, `ne`, `not`, `ge`, `le`, `in`, `startsWith`, and `eq` on `null` values), `$search`, and `$orderby`. |
| groupMembershipClaims | String | Configures the `groups` claim issued in a user or OAuth 2.0 access token that the application expects. To set this attribute, use one of the following string values: `None`, `SecurityGroup` (for security groups and Microsoft Entra roles), `All` (this gets all security groups, distribution groups, and Microsoft Entra directory roles that the signed-in user is a member of). |
| id | String | Unique identifier for the application object. This property is referred to as **Object ID** in the Microsoft Entra admin center. Inherited from [directoryObject](directoryobject.md). Key. Not nullable. Read-only. Supports `$filter` (`eq`, `ne`, `not`, `in`). |
| identifierUris | String collection | Also known as App ID URI, this value is set when an application is used as a resource app. The identifierUris acts as the prefix for the scopes you reference in your API's code, and it must be globally unique across Microsoft Entra ID. For more information on valid identifierUris patterns and best practices, see [Microsoft Entra application registration security best practices](/entra/identity-platform/security-best-practices-for-app-registration#application-id-uri-also-known-as-identifier-uri). Not nullable. <br><br>Supports `$filter` (`eq`, `ne`, `ge`, `le`, `startsWith`). |
| info | [informationalUrl](informationalurl.md) | Basic profile information of the application, such as it's marketing, support, terms of service, and privacy statement URLs. The terms of service and privacy statement are surfaced to users through the user consent experience. For more information, see [How to: Add Terms of service and privacy statement for registered Microsoft Entra apps](/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-add-terms-of-service-privacy-statement). <br><br>Supports `$filter` (`eq`, `ne`, `not`, `ge`, `le`, and `eq` on `null` values). |
| isDeviceOnlyAuthSupported | Boolean | Specifies whether this application supports device authentication without a user. The default is `false`.  |
| isFallbackPublicClient | Boolean | Specifies the fallback application type as public client, such as an installed application running on a mobile device. The default value is `false`, which means the fallback application type is confidential client such as a web app. There are certain scenarios where Microsoft Entra ID can't determine the client application type. For example, the [ROPC](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.3) flow where the application is configured without specifying a redirect URI. In those cases Microsoft Entra ID interprets the application type based on the value of this property.|

The possible values are: `AzureADMyOrg` (default), `AzureADMultipleOrgs`, `AzureADandPersonalMicrosoftAccount`, and `PersonalMicrosoftAccount`. See more in the [table](#signinaudience-values). <br/><br/>The value of this object also limits the number of permissions an app can request. For more information, see [Limits on requested permissions per app](#limits-on-requested-permissions-per-app). <br><br>The value for this property has implications on other app object properties. As a result, if you change this property, you may need to change other properties first. For more information, see [Validation differences for signInAudience](/azure/active-directory/develop/supported-accounts-validation?context=graph/context).<br><br>Supports `$filter` (`eq`, `ne`, `not`).|
| servicePrincipalLockConfiguration | [servicePrincipalLockConfiguration](servicePrincipalLockConfiguration.md) | Specifies whether sensitive properties of a multitenant application should be locked for editing after the application is provisioned in a tenant. Nullable. `null` by default. |
