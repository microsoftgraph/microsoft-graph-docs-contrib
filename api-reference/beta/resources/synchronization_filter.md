# filter resource type

Scoping filters (when present) determine which objects should be provisioned to the application. For example, we might want to only provision users which are located in the US. When scoping filter is present, *objects which do not satisfy the filter will be skipped* during synchronization.

Filter is part of [object mapping](synchronization_objectMapping.md). It consists of several sets of filter groups, and each filter group holds one or more clauses. An object is considered in scope for the group (group is evaluated to `true`) **if, and only if ALL of the clauses of the group are evaluated to `true`**.

An object is considered in scope for the group set (group set is evaluated to `true`) **if ANY of the groups in the set is evaluated to `true`**.

For additional information, please also see [Attribute-based application provisioning with scoping filters](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/active-directory-saas-scoping-filters)

## Properties
| Property	   | Type	|Description|
|:---------------|:--------|:----------|
|categoryFilterGroups|[filterGroup](filtergroup.md) collection| Filter group set used to decide whether given object belongs and should be processed as part of this object mapping. An object is considered in scope *if ANY of the groups in the collection is evaluated to `true`*. ** *Experimental, not recommended for use.* **|
|groups|[filterGroup](filtergroup.md) collection|Filter group set used to decide whether given object is in scope for provisioning. **This is the filter which should be used in most cases**. If an object used to satisfy this filter at a given moment, and then the object or the filter was changed so that filter is not satisfied any longer, such object *will get de-provisioned". An object is considered in scope *if ANY of the groups in the collection is evaluated to `true`*.|
|inputFilterGroups|[filterGroup](filtergroup.md) collection|Filter group set used to filter out objects at the early stage of reading them from the directory. If an object doesn't satisfy this filter it will not be processed further. Important to understand is that if an object used to satisfy this filter at a given moment, and then the object or the filter was changed so that filter is no longer satisfied, such object *will NOT get de-provisioned*. An object is considered in scope *if ANY of the groups in the collection is evaluated to `true`*. ** *Experimental, not recommended for use.* **|
