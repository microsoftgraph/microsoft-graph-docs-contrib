## accessReviewSettings resource type

The **accessReviewSettings** resource type provides additional settings when creating an access review, to control the feature behavior when starting an access review. This type has the following properties. 

| Property                     | Type                      | Description |
| :--------------------------- | :------------------------ | :---------- |
| `mailNotificationsEnabled`|`Boolean`                | Flag to indicate whether sending mails to reviewers and the review creator is enabled.                |
| `remindersEnabled`|`Boolean`       | Flag to indicate whether sending reminder emails to reviewers are enabled.       |
| `justificationRequiredOnApproval`|`Boolean` | Flag to indicate whether reviewers are required to provide a justification when reviewing access.|
| `activityDurationInDays`|`Int64` | The number of days of user activities to show to reviewers. |
| `autoReviewEnabled`|`Boolean` | Flag to indicate whether the feature should set a decision if the reviewer did not supply one, for use with auto-apply, is enabled. |
| `autoReviewSettings`|`microsoft.graph.autoReviewSettings` | Detailed settings for how the feature should set the review decision, for use with auto-apply, described below. |
| `recurrenceSettings`|`microsoft.graph.accessReviewRecurrenceSettings` | Detailed settings for recurrence, described below. |
| `autoApplyReviewResultsEnabled`|`Boolean` | Flag to indicate whether auto-apply capability, to automatically change the target object access resource, is enabled.  If not enabled, a user must, after the review completes, apply the access review. |
| `accessRecommendationsEnabled`|`Boolean` | Flag to indicate whether showing recommendations to reviewers is enabled. |

## autoReviewSettings resource type

The **autoReviewSettings** resource type is embedded within the access review settings, and along with **autoReviewEnabled**, specifies the behavior for the feature when an access review completes. The resource has one property, **notReviewedResult**. If you don't want to have a review decision recorded unless the reviewer makes an explicit choice, set **autoReviewEnabled** to false. If you want to have the system provide a decision even if the reviewer does not make a choice, set **autoReviewEnabled** to `true` and include **autoReviewSettings** with the **notReviewedResult** property. Then, when a review completes, based on the **notReviewedResult** property, the decision will be recorded to either `Approve` or `Deny`.   

| Property                     | Type     | Description                          |
| :--------------------------- | :------  | :----------                          |
| `notReviewedResult`          |`String`  | Must be one of `Approve`, `Deny`, or `Recommendation`.  If `Recommendation`, then `accessRecommendationsEnabled` in the settings should also be set to true. |


## accessReviewRecurrenceSettings resource type

The **accessReviewRecurrenceSettings** resource type is embedded within the access review settings, and specifies that the access review recurs at regular intervals.  This type has the following properties.

| Property                     | Type                                                                                                          | Description |

| `recurrenceEndType`|`String` | How the recurrence ends. If it is `never`, then there is no explicit end of the recurrence series. If it is `endBy`, then the recurrence ends at a certain date. If it is `occurrences`, then the series ends after `recurrenceCount` instances of the review have completed. |
| `durationInDays`|`Int32`     | The duration in days for recurrence.                                                                              |
