# user resource type

> **Important**: APIs under the /beta version in Microsoft Graph are in preview and are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported.

Represents an Azure AD user account. Inherits from [directoryObject](directoryobject.md).

This resource supports:

- Adding your own data to custom properties using [extensions](../../../concepts/extensibility_overview.md).
- Using [delta query](../../../concepts/delta_query_overview.md) to track incremental additions, deletions, and updates, by providing a [delta](../api/user_delta.md) function.
