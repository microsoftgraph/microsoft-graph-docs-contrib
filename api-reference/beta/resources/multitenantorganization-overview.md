# Multi-tenant organization API overview

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

The multi-tenant organization feature allows you to define an organization with more than one instance of Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). A multi-tenant organization enables multiple tenants to collaborate like a single entity.

## Multi-tenant organization setup

In the directory, a multi-tenant organization represents a group of tenants that belong to your parent organization. This group of tenants is shared and agreed-upon between the tenant administrators through a collaborative setup process.

One tenant creates the multi-tenant organization. The tenant that creates the multi-tenant organization is assigned the multi-tenant organization role of owner. A multi-tenant organization owner has permissions to add tenants into a pending state, remove tenants from the multi-tenant organization, and change the role of any multi-tenant organization tenant.

To join the multi-tenant organization, pending tenants must submit a join request to join the multi-tenant organization and turn their multi-tenant organization status to active. Joined or active tenants typically start with the multi-tenant organization member role. Any multi-tenant organization member tenant has the permissions to leave the multi-tenant organization.

## Cross-tenant access settings and templates

Cross-tenant access partner configurations and identity synchronization policies are required between all tenant pairs in a multi-tenant organization. If they don't already exist at the time of any pending tenant joining a multi-tenant organization, partner configurations and synchronization policies for a joining tenant are autogenerated in an unconfigured state.

Optional multi-tenant organization templates for partner configurations and identity synchronization policies, if configured, allow for the automatic modification of existing or autogenerated partner configurations and identity synchronization policies for any pending tenant joining a multi-tenant organization, at the time of joining.

## Multi-tenant organization size limitation

A multi-tenant organization has a default maximum of 5 active tenants, including owner tenants. If this maximum is exceeded by any submitted join request, the join request will fail.

Also, at the time of joining, multi-tenant organization tenants can have a default maximum of 100,000 internal users per active tenant. If this maximum is exceeded at the time of any submitted join request, the join request will fail.

If you need to increase these limits, you can submit a support request using the Azure portal or Microsoft Entra admin center. In your request, include the tenant ID of one owner tenant and a list of all tenant IDs that are intended to be part of the finalized multi-tenant organization.
