Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Represents details about async operations running on a Microsoft Teams-enabled [device](../resources/teamworkdevice.md), including operation status. Any async operation running on a device creates a **teamworkDeviceOperation** object.

Inherits from [entity](../resources/entity.md).

|:---|:---|:---|
|[List](../api/teamworkdeviceoperation-list.md)|[teamworkDeviceOperation](../resources/teamworkdeviceoperation.md) collection|Get a list of the [teamworkDeviceOperation](../resources/teamworkdeviceoperation.md) objects and their properties.|
|[Get](../api/teamworkdeviceoperation-get.md)|[teamworkDeviceOperation](../resources/teamworkdeviceoperation.md)|Read the properties and relationships of a [teamworkDeviceOperation](../resources/teamworkdeviceoperation.md) object.|
