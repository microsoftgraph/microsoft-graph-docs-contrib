# orgContact resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Represents an organizational contact. Organizational contacts are managed by an organization's administrators and are different from [personal contacts](contact.md). Additionally, organizational contacts are either synchronized from on-premises directories or from Exchange Online, and are read-only.

Inherits from [directoryObject](directoryobject.md).

This resource supports using [delta query](/graph/delta-query-overview) to track incremental additions, deletions, and updates, by providing a [delta](../api/orgcontact-delta.md) function.
