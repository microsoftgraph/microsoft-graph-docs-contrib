# Device management in Microsoft Intune

Namespace: microsoft.graph

> **Important:** APIs under the /beta version in Microsoft Graph are in preview and are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported.

> **Note:** The Microsoft Graph API for Intune requires an [active Intune license](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=839381) for the tenant.

Use the Microsoft Intune Device Management workload to manage settings and features on all of the devices you manage. See the table of content for a list of resources.
