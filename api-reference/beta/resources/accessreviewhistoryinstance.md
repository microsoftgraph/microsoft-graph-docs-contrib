# accessReviewHistoryInstance resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

 Represents a recurrence of an [accessReviewHistoryDefinition](accessreviewhistorydefinition.md) object. A history definition that doesn't recur has exactly one instance.

 Every **accessReviewHistoryInstance** along with its associated **accessReviewHistoryDefinition** contain the properties **reviewHistoryPeriodStartDateTime**, **reviewHistoryPeriodEndDateTime**, **decisions**, **scheduleSettings**, and **scopes**. These properties are used when scheduling recurrences and selecting review data and can be modified. Each **accessReviewHistoryInstance** object and data is only available for 30 days. Once an **accessReviewHistoryInstance** status has been moved to `done`, a link can be generated to retrieve the instance's data by calling [generateDownloadUri](../api/accessreviewhistoryinstance-generatedownloaduri.md).
