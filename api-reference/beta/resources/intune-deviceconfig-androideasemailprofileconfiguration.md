# androidEasEmailProfileConfiguration resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph

> **Important:** Microsoft supports Intune /beta APIs, but they are subject to more frequent change. Microsoft recommends using version v1.0 when possible. Check an API's availability in version v1.0 using the Version selector.

> **Note:** The Microsoft Graph API for Intune requires an [active Intune license](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=839381) for the tenant.

By providing configurations in this profile you can instruct the native email client on KNOX devices to communicate with an Exchange server and get email, contacts, calendar, tasks, and notes. Furthermore, you can also specify how much email to sync and how often the device should sync.
