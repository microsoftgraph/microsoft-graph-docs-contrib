# azureAdJoinPolicy resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Represents the policy scope of the Azure Active Directory tenant that controls the ability for users and groups to register device identities to your organization using Azure AD Join. Only the read and update operations are supported on this resource; create and delete are not supported.

## Properties
|Property|Type|Description|
|:---|:---|:---|
|allowedGroups|String collection|Group IDs in scope of policy. Required when used with the `selected` value in the `appliesTo` property.|
|allowedUsers|String collection|User IDs in scope of policy. Required when used with the `selected` value in the `appliesTo` property.|
|appliesTo|policyScope|Specifies whether to block, allow or fine-grained control of the policy scope. Possible values are: `none`, `all`, `selected`, `unknownFutureValue`. Required.|
|isAdminConfigurable|Boolean|Specifies whether this `policyScope` is configurable by the admin. Read-only.|

## Special considerations when using `appliesTo`
* The default value is **`all`** at time of policy creation.
* You must have at least one **`allowedGroup`** or **`allowedUser`** when using **`selected`**.
* The value of **`all`** or **`none`** will remove all values in **`allowedGroups`** and **`allowedUsers`**.
