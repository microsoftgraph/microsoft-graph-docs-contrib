# Use the notifications REST API in Microsoft Graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

You can use the notifications API in Microsoft Graph to send push notifications to a user. Simply post a notification to your target user, and the platform will deliver the notification to all device endpoints registered to that user. The high-level flow is as follows:

1. User signs in to your application, which creates a subscription with the Microsoft Graph notification service. A specific user notification subscription ID or UNSID will be returned to the calling application.
2. The application sends this UNSID to your application service.
3. When ready to send a notification, your application service [authenticates with the Microsoft identity platform](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/v1-oauth2-client-creds-grant-flow) and posts a notification via the Microsoft Graph notification service, providing the auth token, target user's UNSID, and notification payload.
4. The Microsoft Graph notification service fans-out notifications to all endpoints of the user with an active subscription.  

This type of user-centric notification is represented by the [notification](../resources/projectrome-notification.md) resource and is stored within the Microsoft Graph notification service. It can then be accessed and managed by the client application via the [client-side SDK APIs](https://aka.ms/GNSDK). If you're new to the Microsoft Graph notification service, check out the [notification overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/graph/notifications-concept-overview) section to learn more.
