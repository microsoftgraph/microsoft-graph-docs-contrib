# tooManyGlobalAdminsAssignedToTenantAlertConfiguration resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Represents an alert configuration that is triggered if too many accounts in the tenant are assigned the Global Administrator Microsoft Entra role. [Global Administrator](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference?toc=%2Fgraph%2Ftoc.json#global-administrator) is the highest privileged role in Microsoft Entra ID. If an account with global administrator privileges is compromised, the malicious actor has permissions for almost all actions in the tenant, which puts the whole system at risk.

Triggered if two different criteria are met, and you can configure both of them. First, you need to reach a certain threshold of Global administrator role assignments. Second, a certain percentage of your total role assignments must be Global administrators. If you only meet one of these measurements, the alert doesn't appear.

Inherits from [unifiedRoleManagementAlertConfiguration](../resources/unifiedrolemanagementalertconfiguration.md).

## Properties
|Property|Type|Description|
|:---|:---|:---|
|alertDefinitionId|String|The identifier of an alert definition. Inherited from [unifiedRoleManagementAlertConfiguration](../resources/unifiedrolemanagementalertconfiguration.md). Supports `$filter` (`eq`, `ne`).|
|globalAdminCountThreshold|Int32| The threshold for the number of accounts assigned the Global Administrator role in the tenant. Triggers an alert if the number of global administrators in the tenant reaches or crosses this threshold value. |
|id|String|The identifier of the alert configuration. Inherited from [entity](../resources/entity.md).|
|isEnabled|Boolean|`true` if the alert is enabled. Setting it to `false` disables PIM scanning the tenant to identify instances that trigger this alert. Inherited from [unifiedRoleManagementAlertConfiguration](../resources/unifiedrolemanagementalertconfiguration.md).|
