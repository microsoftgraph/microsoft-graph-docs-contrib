# tiIndicator resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Threat intelligence (TI) indicators represent data used to identify malicious activities. If your organization works with threat indicators, either by generating your own, obtaining them from open source feeds, sharing with partner organizations or communities, or by purchasing feeds of data, you might want to use these indicators in various security tools for matching with log data. The Microsoft Graph Security API **tiIndicators** entity allows you to upload your threat indicators to Microsoft security tools for the actions of allow, block, or alert.

Threat indicators uploaded via **tiIndicators** will be used in conjunction with Microsoft threat intelligence to provide a customized security solution for your organization. When using the **tiIndicators** entity, you specify the Microsoft security solution you want to utilize the indicators for via the **targetProduct** property and you specify the action (allow, block, or alert) to which the security solution should apply the indicators via the **action** property.

Current **targetProduct** support includes the following:

- **Azure Sentinel** – Supports all documented **tiIndicators** methods listed in the following section.
- **Microsoft Defender ATP (Microsoft Defender Advanced Threat Protection)** – Supports the following **tiIndicators** methods:
     - [Get tiIndicator](../api/tiindicator-get.md)
     - [Create tiIndicator](../api/tiindicators-post.md)
     - [List tiIndicators](../api/tiindicators-list.md)
     - [Update](../api/tiindicator-update.md)
     - [Delete](../api/tiindicator-delete.md)

     Support for the bulk methods is coming soon.

  > [!NOTE]
  >The following indicator types are supported by Microsoft Defender ATP targetProduct:
  > - Files
  > - IP addresses: Microsoft Defender ATP supports destination IPv4/IPv6 only – set property in networkDestinationIPv4 or    networkDestinationIPv6 properties in Microsoft Graph Security API **tiIndicator**.
  > - URLs/domains

   There is a limit of 15000 indicators per tenant for Microsoft Defender ATP.

For details about the types of indicators supported and limits on indicator counts per tenant, see [Manage indicators](/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-atp/manage-indicators).

|expirationDateTime|DateTimeOffset| DateTime string indicating when the Indicator expires. All indicators must have an expiration date to avoid stale indicators persisting in the system. The Timestamp type represents date and time information using ISO 8601 format and is always in UTC time. For example, midnight UTC on Jan 1, 2014 is `2014-01-01T00:00:00Z`. **Required.**|
|externalId|String| An identification number that ties the indicator back to the indicator provider’s system (e.g. a foreign key). |
|id|String|Created by the system when the indicator is ingested. Generated GUID/unique identifier. Read-only.|
|ingestedDateTime|DateTimeOffset| Stamped by the system when the indicator is ingested. The Timestamp type represents date and time information using ISO 8601 format and is always in UTC time. For example, midnight UTC on Jan 1, 2014 is `2014-01-01T00:00:00Z`|

|passiveOnly|Boolean |Determines if the indicator should trigger an event that is visible to an end-user. When set to ‘true,’ security tools will not notify the end user that a ‘hit’ has occurred. This is most often treated as audit or silent mode by security products where they will simply log that a match occurred but will not perform the action. Default value is false. |
|severity|Int32| An integer representing the severity of the malicious behavior identified by the data within the indicator. Acceptable values are 0 – 5 where 5 is the most severe and zero is not severe at all. Default value is 3. |
