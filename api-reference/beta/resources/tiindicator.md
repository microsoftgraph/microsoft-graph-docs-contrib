# tiIndicator resource type (deprecated)

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

> [!NOTE]
> The [tiIndicator](tiindicator.md) entity is deprecated and will be removed by April 2026.

Represents data used to identify malicious activities. 

If your organization works with threat indicators, either by generating your own, obtaining them from open source feeds, sharing with partner organizations or communities, or by purchasing feeds of data, you might want to use these indicators in various security tools for matching with log data. The **tiIndicators** entity allows you to upload your threat indicators to Microsoft security tools for the actions of allow, block, or alert.

Threat indicators uploaded via **tiIndicator** are used with Microsoft threat intelligence to provide a customized security solution for your organization. When using the **tiIndicator** entity, specify the Microsoft security solution you want to utilize the indicators via the **targetProduct** property, and specify the action (allow, block, or alert) to which the security solution should apply the indicators via the **action** property.

Currently, **targetProduct** supports the following products:

- **Microsoft Defender for Endpoint** – Supports the following **tiIndicators** methods:
     - [Get tiIndicator](../api/tiindicator-get.md)
     - [Create tiIndicator](../api/tiindicators-post.md)
     - [List tiIndicators](../api/tiindicators-list.md)
     - [Update](../api/tiindicator-update.md)
     - [Delete](../api/tiindicator-delete.md)

  > [!NOTE]
  >The following indicator types are supported by Microsoft Defender for Endpoint targetProduct:
  > - Files
  > - IP addresses: Microsoft Defender for Endpoint supports destination IPv4/IPv6 only – set property in networkDestinationIPv4 or    networkDestinationIPv6 properties in Microsoft Graph Security API **tiIndicator**.
  > - URLs/domains

   There's a limit of 15,000 indicators per tenant for Microsoft Defender for Endpoint.

- **Microsoft Sentinel** – For the most up-to-date, detailed instructions on how to send threat intelligent indicators to Microsoft Sentinel, see [Connect your threat intelligence platform to Microsoft Sentinel with the upload API](/azure/sentinel/connect-threat-intelligence-upload-api).
  
For details about the types of indicators supported and limits on indicator counts per tenant, see [Manage indicators](/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-atp/manage-indicators).

|activityGroupNames|String collection|The cyber threat intelligence name(s) for the parties responsible for the malicious activity covered by the threat indicator.|
|additionalInformation|String|A catchall area for extra data from the indicator that is not specifically covered by other tiIndicator properties. The security tool specified by targetProduct typically does not utilize this data.|
|azureTenantId|String| Stamped by the system when the indicator is ingested. The Microsoft Entra tenant id of submitting client. **Required.**|
|confidence|Int32|An integer representing the confidence the data within the indicator accurately identifies malicious behavior. Acceptable values are 0 – 100 with 100 being the highest.|
|description|String| Brief description (100 characters or less) of the threat represented by the indicator. **Required.**|
|diamondModel|[diamondModel](#diamondmodel-values)|The area of the Diamond Model in which this indicator exists. Possible values are: `unknown`, `adversary`, `capability`, `infrastructure`, `victim`.|
|expirationDateTime|DateTimeOffset| DateTime string indicating when the Indicator expires. All indicators must have an expiration date to avoid stale indicators persisting in the system. The Timestamp type represents date and time information using ISO 8601 format and is always in UTC time. For example, midnight UTC on Jan 1, 2014 is `2014-01-01T00:00:00Z`. **Required.**|
|externalId|String| An identification number that ties the indicator back to the indicator provider’s system (for example, a foreign key). |
|id|String|Created by the system when the indicator is ingested. Generated GUID/unique identifier. Read-only.|
|ingestedDateTime|DateTimeOffset| Stamped by the system when the indicator is ingested. The Timestamp type represents date and time information using ISO 8601 format and is always in UTC time. For example, midnight UTC on Jan 1, 2014 is `2014-01-01T00:00:00Z`|

|passiveOnly|Boolean |Determines if the indicator should trigger an event that is visible to an end-user. When set to ‘true,’ security tools won't notify the end user that a ‘hit’ has occurred. This is most often treated as audit or silent mode by security products where they'll simply log that a match occurred but won't perform the action. Default value is false. |
|severity|Int32| An integer representing the severity of the malicious behavior identified by the data within the indicator. Acceptable values are 0 – 5 where 5 is the most severe and zero isn't severe at all. Default value is 3. |
|tags|String collection|A JSON array of strings that stores arbitrary tags/keywords. |
|targetProduct|String|A string value representing a single security product to which the indicator should be applied. Acceptable values are: `Azure Sentinel`, `Microsoft Defender ATP`. **Required**|
