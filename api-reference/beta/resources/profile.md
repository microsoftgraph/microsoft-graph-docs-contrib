# profile resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Represents properties that are descriptive of a user in a tenant; for example, anniversaries and education activities. These properties are surfaced in shared people experiences across Microsoft 365 and third-party services and experiences via Microsoft Graph.

Programmatically, these properties are expressed as [relationships](#relationships) of the **profile** resource. To get one of these navigation properties or create an instance of these properties for the user, use the corresponding GET or POST method on that property, where applicable. For more details, see the [Methods](#methods) section.

In addition to the navigation properties in the [Relationships](#relationships) section, other properties exclusive to first-party applications, such as user pronouns, aren't exposed on Microsoft Graph.
