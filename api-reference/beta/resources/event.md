# event resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

An event in a [user](user.md) calendar, or the default calendar of a Microsoft 365 [group](group.md).

The maximum number of attendees included in an **event**, and the maximum number of recipients in an [eventMessage](eventmessage.md) sent from an Exchange Online mailbox is 500. For more information, see [sending limits](/office365/servicedescriptions/exchange-online-service-description/exchange-online-limits#sending-limits).

This resource supports:

- Adding your own data to custom properties as [extensions](/graph/extensibility-overview).
- Subscribing to [change notifications](/graph/webhooks).
- Using [delta query](/graph/delta-query-overview) to track incremental additions, deletions, and updates, by providing a [delta](../api/event-delta.md) function.

> **Note:** There are a few minor differences in the way you can interact with user calendars, group calendars, and their events:

- You can organize only user calendars in a [calendarGroup](calendargroup.md).
- You can add [attachment](attachment.md) objects to events in only user calendars, but not to events in group calendars.
- Outlook automatically accepts all meeting requests on behalf of groups. You can [accept](../api/event-accept.md), [tentatively accept](../api/event-tentativelyaccept.md), or [decline](../api/event-decline.md)  meeting requests for _user_ calendars only.
- Outlook doesn't support reminders for group events. You can [snooze](../api/event-snoozereminder.md) or [dismiss](../api/event-dismissreminder.md) a [reminder](reminder.md) for _user_ calendars only.

|cancelledOccurrences|String collection|Contains **occurrenceId** property values of canceled instances in a recurring series, if the event is the series master. Instances in a recurring series that are canceled are called cancelledOccurences.<br><br>Returned only on $select in a [Get](../api/event-get.md) operation which specifies the id of a series master event (that is, the seriesMasterId property value).|
|categories|String collection|The categories associated with the event. Each category corresponds to the **displayName** property of an [outlookCategory](outlookcategory.md) defined for the user.|

|importance|String|The importance of the event. Possible values are: `low`, `normal`, `high`.|

|occurrenceId|String|An identifier for an occurrence in a recurring event series. Null if the event isn't part of a recurring series.<br><br>The format of the property value is OID.{seriesMasterId-value}.{occurrence-start-date}. The time zone for {occurrence-start-date} is the recurrenceTimeZone property defined for the corresponding [recurrenceRange](recurrencerange.md).<br><br>This property can identify any occurrence in a recurring series, including an occurrence that has been modified or canceled. You can use this property to perform all operations supported by occurrences in the recurring series.|
|onlineMeeting|[OnlineMeetingInfo](onlinemeetinginfo.md)| Details for an attendee to join the meeting online. Default is null. Read-only. <br>After you set the **isOnlineMeeting** and **onlineMeetingProvider** properties to enable a meeting online, Microsoft Graph initializes **onlineMeeting**.

This property isn't returned for events that are single instances. Its date and time information is expressed in ISO 8601 format and is always in UTC. For example, midnight UTC on Jan 1, 2014 is `2014-01-01T00:00:00Z`|
|originalStartTimeZone|String|The start time zone that was set when the event was created. A value of `tzone://Microsoft/Custom` indicates that a legacy custom time zone was set in desktop Outlook.|
|recurrence|[PatternedRecurrence](patternedrecurrence.md)|The recurrence pattern for the event.|
|reminderMinutesBeforeStart|Int32|The number of minutes before the event start time that the reminder alert occurs.|

|transactionId|String|A custom identifier specified by a client app for the server to avoid redundant [POST](../api/calendar-post-events.md) operations if the client retries to create the same event. This is useful when low network connectivity causes the client to time out before receiving a response from the server for the client's prior create-event request. After you set **transactionId** when creating an event, you can't change **transactionId** in a subsequent update. This property is only returned in a response payload if an app has set it. Optional.|
|type|String|The event type. Possible values are: `singleInstance`, `occurrence`, `exception`, `seriesMaster`. Read-only|
|uid|String|A unique identifier for calendar events. For recurring events, the value is the same for the series master and all of its occurrences including exceptions.|
|webLink|String|The URL to open the event in Outlook on the web.<br/><br/>Outlook on the web opens the event in the browser if you're signed in to your mailbox. Otherwise, Outlook on the web prompts you to sign in.<br/><br/>This URL can't be accessed from within an iFrame.|

> [!NOTE]
> The **webLink** property specifies a URL that opens the event in only earlier versions of Outlook on the web. The following is its URL format, with _{event-id}_ being the _**URL-encoded**_ value of the **id** property:

> * For Microsoft accounts:
>  `https://outlook.live.com/calendar/item/{event-id}`
