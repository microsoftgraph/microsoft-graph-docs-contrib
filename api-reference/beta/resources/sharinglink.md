# sharingLink resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

The **sharingLink** resource groups link-related data items into a single structure.

If a [**permission**](permission.md) resource has a non-null **sharingLink** facet, the permission represents a sharing link (as opposed to permissions granted to a person or group).

| scope          | String        | The scope of the link represented by this permission. Value `anonymous` indicates the link is usable by anyone, `organization` indicates the link is only usable for users signed into the same tenant.
