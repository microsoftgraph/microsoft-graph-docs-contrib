# Microsoft Entra authentication methods API overview

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

[Authentication methods](/entra/identity/authentication/concept-authentication-methods) are the ways that users authenticate in Microsoft Entra ID. Authentication methods in Microsoft Entra ID include password and phone (for example, SMS and voice calls), which are manageable in Microsoft Graph today, among many others such as FIDO2 security keys and the Microsoft Authenticator app. Authentication methods are used in primary, second-factor, and step-up authentication, and also in the self-service password reset (SSPR) process.

The authentication method APIs are used to manage a user's authentication methods. For example:

* You can add a phone number to a user. The user can then use that phone number for SMS and voice call authentication if they're enabled to use it by policy.
* You can update that number, or delete it from the user.
* You can enable or disable the number for SMS sign-in.
* You can reset a user's password.
* You can retrieve details of a user's FIDO2 Security Key, and delete it if the user has lost the key.
* You can retrieve details of a user's Microsoft Authenticator registration, and delete it if the user has lost the phone.
* You can retrieve details of a user's Windows Hello for Business registration, and delete it if the user has lost the device.
* You can add an email address to a user. The user can then use that email as part of the Self-Service Password Reset (SSPR) process.
* You can update that email, or delete it from the user.
* You can assign and activate a hardware OATH token for a user.
* You can retrieve details of a user's QR code authentication, and delete standard QR code if they lost it.

The ability for a user to use an authentication method is governed by the [authentication method policy](authenticationmethodspolicies-overview.md) for the tenant. For example, only users in the R&D department might be enabled to use the FIDO2 method while all users might be enabled to use Microsoft Authenticator.

We don't recommend using the authentication methods APIs for scenarios where you need to iterate over your entire user population for auditing or security check purposes. For these types of scenarios, we recommend using the [authentication method registration and usage reporting APIs](../resources/authenticationmethods-usage-insights-overview.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Requests to the authentication methods APIs time-out after 60 seconds.

## What authentication methods can be managed in Microsoft Graph?

|Authentication method       | Description |Examples     |
|:---------------------------|:------------|:------------|
|[emailAuthenticationMethod](emailauthenticationmethod.md)|A user can use an email address as part of the Self-Service Password Reset (SSPR) process.|See a user's authentication email address. Add, update, or remove an email address to a user.|
|[fido2AuthenticationMethod](fido2authenticationmethod.md)|A user can use a FIDO2 security key to sign-in to Microsoft Entra ID.|Delete a lost FIDO2 Security Key.|
|[hardwareOathAuthenticationMethod](hardwareoathauthenticationmethod.md)|Allow users to perform multifactor authentication using a hardware OATH device that provides a one-time code.|Get (un)assign or (de)activate a hardware token to a user.|
|[microsoftAuthenticatorAuthenticationMethod](microsoftauthenticatorauthenticationmethod.md)|A user can use Microsoft Authenticator app to sign-in or perform multi-factor authentication to Microsoft Entra ID|Delete a Microsoft Authenticator authentication method.|
|[passwordAuthenticationMethod](passwordauthenticationmethod.md)| A password is currently the default primary authentication method in Microsoft Entra ID.|Reset a user's password|
|[phoneAuthenticationMethod](phoneauthenticationmethod.md)| user can use a phone to authenticate using [SMS or voice calls](/azure/active-directory/authentication/concept-authentication-methods#phone-options) as allowed by policy.|See a user's authentication phone numbers. Add, update, or remove a phone number to a user. Enable or disable a primary mobile phone for SMS sign-in.|
|[platformCredentialAuthenticationMethod](platformcredentialauthenticationmethod.md)|Platform Credential is a sign-in authentication method for users on macOS devices.|See a user's platform credentials. Remove a user's platform credential.|
|[softwareOathAuthenticationMethod](../resources/softwareoathauthenticationmethod.md)| Allow users to perform multifactor authentication using an application that supports the OATH specification and provides a one-time code. | Get and delete a software token assigned to a user.|
|[temporaryaccesspassauthenticationmethod](temporaryaccesspassauthenticationmethod.md)|Temporary Access Pass is a time-limited passcode that serves as a strong credential and allows onboarding of passwordless credentials. | Set a new Temporary Access Pass on a user.|
|[windowsHelloForBusinessAuthenticationMethod](windowsHelloForBusinessAuthenticationMethod.md)|Windows Hello for Business is a passwordless sign-in method on Windows devices.|See devices where a user has enabled Windows Hello for Business sign-in. Delete a Windows Hello for Business credential.|
|[Authentication states](authentication.md)|Manage a user's sign-in preferences and per-user MFA|See or set the MFA state for a user. See or set the system-preferred multifactor authentication (MFA) setting.|
|[qrCodePinAuthenticationMethod](qrcodepinauthenticationmethod.md) |QR code is an authentication method designed for frontline workers for simple authentication experience. Users just need to scan unique QR code provided to them and enter their PIN to sign in into apps. | Add QR code authentication method for a user.|
|[passwordlessmicrosoftauthenticatorauthenticationmethod](passwordlessmicrosoftauthenticatorauthenticationmethod.md) (deprecated)|Microsoft Authenticator Passwordless Phone sign-in can be used by a user to sign in to Microsoft Entra ID|Delete a Passwordless Phone sign-in authentication method.|

The following authentication methods aren't yet supported in Microsoft Graph `beta`.

|Authentication method       | Description |Examples     |
|:---------------------------|:------------|:------------|
|Security questions and answers | Allow users to validate their identity when performing a self-service password reset. |Delete a security question a user registered.|

## Require re-register multifactor authentication

To require users to set-up a new multifactor authentication the next time they sign in, call the individual DELETE authentication method operations to delete each of the user's current authentication methods. When the user has no more methods, they're prompted to register the next time they sign in where strong authentication is required.

## Tenant-level authentication method usage

You can monitor tenant-level authentication method registration and usage, including users registered or unregistered for MFA and passwordless authentication, and users registered or unregistered for SSPR by using the [Authentication methods usage report APIs](/graph/api/resources/authenticationmethods-usage-insights-overview).

## Next steps

* Review the authentication method types and their various methods.
* Try the API in [Graph Explorer](https://developer.microsoft.com/graph/graph-explorer).
