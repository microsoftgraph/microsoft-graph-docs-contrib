You can use Intune app protection policies to help protect your company’s data. Because Intune app protection policies can be used independent of any mobile-device management (MDM) solution, you can use it to protect your company’s data with or without enrolling devices in a device management solution. By implementing app-level policies, you can restrict access to company resources and keep data within the purview of your IT department.
