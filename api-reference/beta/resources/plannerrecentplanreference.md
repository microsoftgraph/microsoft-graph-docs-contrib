# plannerRecentPlanReference resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

The **plannerRecentPlanReference** resource type repesents a reference to a [plannerPlan](plannerplan.md) that has recently been viewed by a user. 
The **plannerRecentPlanReferences** for a user are explicitly maintained by apps. Any app that implements the recent plans feature should record when the user last viewed a plan, and update **plannerRecentPlanReference** entries accordingly.
Apps should note that **plannerRecentPlanReference** entries can reference **plannerPlans** that are deleted, that the user can no longer access, or that have been updated with a different title.
We recommend that apps notify users when there are discrepancies and keep the entries up to date.
