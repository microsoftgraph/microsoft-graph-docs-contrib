# connectorGroup resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Each [Microsoft Entra application proxy](/entra/identity/app-proxy/overview-what-is-app-proxy) connector is always part of a connector group. All the connectors that belong to the same connector group act as a separate unit for high-availability and load balancing. If you don't create connector groups, all your connectors will be part of the default group. When configuring an application with Application Proxy, you must also specify which connector group to assign the application to.

After a connector group is created, you can add or move connectors to the connector group by using [Add connector](../api/connectorgroup-post-members.md). You can also use [Add application](../api/connectorgroup-post-applications.md) to assign an application to a connector group.

## Methods

| Method		   | Return Type	|Description|
|:---------------|:--------|:----------|
|[List](../api/connectorgroup-list.md) |[connectorGroup](connectorgroup.md) collection | Retrieve a list of connectorGroup objects. |
|[Create](../api/connectorgroup-post.md) |[connectorGroup](connectorgroup.md) collection | Create a connectorGroup object. |
|[Get](../api/connectorgroup-get.md) | [connectorGroup](connectorgroup.md) | Read properties and relationships of a connectorGroup object. |
|[Update](../api/connectorgroup-update.md) | [connectorGroup](connectorgroup.md)| Update a connectorGroup object. |
|[Delete](../api/connectorgroup-delete.md) | None | Delete a connectorGroup object. All connectors must be removed from the connectorGroup before a connectorGroup can be deleted. |

|[List applications](../api/connectorgroup-list-applications.md) |[application](application.md) collection| Get the application object collection associated with the connectorGroup. |
|[Add application](../api/connectorgroup-post-applications.md) |[application](application.md)| Associate an application with the connectorGroup by posting to the applications collection. |
|[Add connector](../api/connectorgroup-post-members.md) |[connector](connector.md)| Add a connector to the connectorGroup by posting to the connectorGroup collection. |
