Device categories provide a way to organize your devices. Using device categories, company administrators can define unique categories that make sense to their company. These categories can then be applied to a device in the Intune Azure console or selected by a user during device enrollment. You can filter reports and create dynamic Azure Active Directory device groups based on device categories.
