> **Important:** Microsoft supports Intune /beta APIs, but they are subject to more frequent change. Microsoft recommends using version v1.0 when possible. Check an API's availability in version v1.0 using the Version selector.

> **Note:** The Microsoft Graph API for Intune requires an [active Intune license](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=839381) for the tenant.

Device categories provide a way to organize your devices. Using device categories, company administrators can define unique categories that make sense to their company.Â These categories can then be applied to a device in the Intune Azure console or selected by a user during device enrollment. You can filter reports and create dynamic Azure Active Directory device groups based on device categories.
