[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

A photo album is a way to virtually group [driveItems][driveItem] with [photo][] facets together in a [bundle][]. Bundles of this type will have the **album** property set on the [bundle][] resource.

## Properties

| Property name     | Type   | Description
|:------------------|:-------|:------------------------------------------------
| coverImageItemId | String | Unique identifier of the [driveItem][] that is the cover of the album.

**Note:** If a **coverImageItemId** has not been set before, the thumbnails for an album are chosen automatically.
After **coverImageItemId** has been set, the thumbnails for an album will always be the item associated with that id.
You can override the default cover by PATCHing the [bundle item][bundle] and setting the **coverImageItemId** property on the `album` to the id of an image contained within the album.
To remove a custom-set cover, you can set the **coverImageItemId** property to null, and a default one will be chosen automatically again.
