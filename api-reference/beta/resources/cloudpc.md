# cloudPC resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Represents a cloud-managed virtual desktop. This Cloud PC is also enrolled in Intune and managed through the Microsoft Endpoint Manager portal, so the Cloud PC also has a corresponding Intune-managed device ID.
