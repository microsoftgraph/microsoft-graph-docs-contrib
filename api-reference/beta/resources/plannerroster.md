# plannerRoster resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Represents a collection of users who are collaborating on a [plannerPlan](plannerplan.md). A **plannerRoster** is a simple set of users, where everyone has the same level of permissions and they can be created by everyone, unless disabled by the tenant administrator. A **plannerRoster** can contain one plan.

Deleting a **plannerRoster** also deletes the plan and all tasks in the plan. A **plannerRoster** is also automatically deleted under the following conditions:

* The **plannerRoster** doesn't contain a plan 24 hours after its creation. Membership information is erased within 30 days of this deletion.
* The **plannerRoster** doesn't have any users remaining in the membership list because the last user removed themselves. Roster, its plan, and all contained tasks are deleted within 30 days of this operation.
* The **plannerRoster** doesn't have any users remaining in the membership list because the last user was permanently deleted. Roster, its plan, and all contained tasks are deleted immediately. Deleted users are permanently erased within 30 days of their deletion; however, tenant administrators can also choose to permanently delete users without this delay.
