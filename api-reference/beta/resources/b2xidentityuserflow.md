# b2xIdentityUserFlow resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Represents a user flow within an Azure Active Directory tenant.

User flows are used to enable a [self-service sign up](/azure/active-directory/external-identities/self-service-sign-up-overview) experience for guest users on an application. User flows define the experience the end user sees while signing up, including which [identity providers](/azure/active-directory/external-identities/identity-providers) they can use to authenticate, along with which attributes are collected as part of the sign up process.
