# printerProcessingStateDetail enum type

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Represents the processing status detail of the printer.

Include the `Prefer: include-unknown-enum-members` header to explicitly request for enum values beyond `unknownFutureValue`. For details, see
[Handling future members in evolvable enumerations](/graph/best-practices-concept#handling-future-members-in-evolvable-enumerations).
