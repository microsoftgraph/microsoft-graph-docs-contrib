# participantJoiningNotification resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Contains details about the policy-based participant joining a call.

Under the [Policy-based recording scenario](/microsoftteams/teams-recording-policy), before a participant under the policy joins a call, a `participantJoiningNotification` will be sent to the bot associated with the policy that has available capacity to handle the new participant.

A [participantJoiningResponse](participantjoiningResponse.md) in the response payload is expected from the bot.
