The **plannerPlanContext** resource represents the relationship of a [plannerPlan](plannerplan.md) to a user experience outside of Planner. Plans in Planner can be surfaced in other experiences, such as Microsoft Teams, to track work in the context of that experience. Experiences that have external links in the [plannerPlanContextDetails](plannerplancontextdetails.md) can be displayed in a user interface, allowing users to visit these experiences.
