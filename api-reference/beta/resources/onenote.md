https://graph.microsoft.com/{version}/users/{userPrincipalName}/onenote/{notebooks | sections | sectionGroups | pages} 
https://graph.microsoft.com/{version}/users/{id}/onenote/{notebooks | sections | sectionGroups | pages} 
```

**Group notebooks** To access notebooks that are owned by a group, use the following service root URL:

```http
https://graph.microsoft.com/{version}/groups/{id}/onenote/{notebooks | sections | sectionGroups | pages} 
```
