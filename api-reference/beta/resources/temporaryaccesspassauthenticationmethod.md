# temporaryAccessPassAuthenticationMethod resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Represents a Temporary Access Pass registered to a user. A Temporary Access Pass is a time-limited passcode that serves as a strong credential and allows onboarding of passwordless credentials. The availability and settings that can be configured for the **temporaryAccessPassAuthenticationMethod** depends on the [Temporary Access Pass methods policy](temporaryaccesspassauthenticationmethodconfiguration.md).

This is a derived type that inherits from the [authenticationMethod](authenticationmethod.md) resource type.
