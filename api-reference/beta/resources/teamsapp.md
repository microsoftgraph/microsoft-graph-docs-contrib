# teamsApp resource type

> **Important:** APIs under the /beta version in Microsoft Graph are in preview and are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported.

An application installed in a [team](team.md). 
Any bots that are part of the app will become part of any team the app is added to.

To find the app ID of an app you want to install, 
use the [Microsoft Teams client UI](http://teams.microsoft.com) to add that app to a test team, 
then use [Graph Explorer](https://developer.microsoft.com/graph/graph-explorer) to [List apps](../api/teams_apps_list.md) in that test team.
