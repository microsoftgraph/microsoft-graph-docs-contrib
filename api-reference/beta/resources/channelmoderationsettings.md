# channelModerationSettings resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

In Microsoft Teams, team owners can turn on moderation for a channel to control who can start new posts and reply to posts in that channel. For example, owners might want to do the following:

- Use a channel for announcements only.
- Use a channel for discussions in a class team where only the teacher can start new discussions.
- Use a channel for livesite issues where new posts can be started by connectors.

By default, moderation is `OFF`, which means that the usual channel settings apply to team owners and team members, with additional control to allow only team members or everyone including guests to start a new channel post. Setting channel moderation to `ON` allows only moderators to start new posts, with additional control for team members.

To support channel moderation settings via Microsoft Graph APIs:

- Team members should be able to query channel moderation settings.
- Team owners should be able to set channel moderation settings.
