# plannerPlanContextDetailsCollection resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]


The **plannerPlanContextDetailsCollection** resource represents the collection of external contexts to which a plan is linked. This resource is an open type and is part of the [plannerPlanDetails](plannerplandetails.md) object. The property name in the property-value pair is an app-specific identifier of the context; the value is the [plannerPlanContextDetails](plannerplancontextdetails.md) object.


## Properties
Properties of an open type can be defined by the client. In this case, the client should use a distinctive identifier that represents the external context as the property name. 
The property values must be [plannerPlanContextDetails](plannerplancontextdetails.md) objects. Based on OData, property names in open types cannot contain the following characters: `.`, `:`, `@`, `%`. These characters need to be encoded with URL encoding format. To remove an item in the favorites list, the value needs to be removed from the [plannerPlanContextCollection](plannerplancontextcollection.md) collection instead, which will automatically remove the entry in this object.
