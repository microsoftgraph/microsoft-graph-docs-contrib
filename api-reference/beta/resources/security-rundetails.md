#### Failure Reasons table

| errorCode                | Reason                                                                                                                                                                   |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| queryExecutionFailed     | An unexpected error occurred during query execution. Contact support if this failure reoccurs.                                                                                   |
| queryExecutionThrottling | Query execution was throttled due to exceeded tenant resources.                                                                                                          |
| queryExceededResultSize  | Result size limit exceeded. Only the first 100 query results were processed.                                                                                             |
| queryLimitsExceeded      | Query execution was preempted. This failure can be due to high CPU and/or memory resource consumption. Optimize your query by following best practices and try again. |
| queryTimeout             | Query execution took longer than the assigned timeout and was aborted.                                                                                              |
| alertCreationFailed      | An unexpected error occurred while generating alerts from query results. Contact support if this failure reoccurs.                                                               |
| alertReportNotFound      | An event couldn't be matched to the given Timestamp, DeviceId, or ReportId. Check the query for aggregation expressions on those columns.                                  |
| partialRowsFailed        | Only a subset of query results could be processed to alerts. Contact support if this failure reoccurs.                                                                           |
