# AudioRoutingGroup resource type

> **Important:** APIs under the /beta version in Microsoft Graph are in preview and are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported.

The audio routing group stores information about a private (participant-owned) Audio Routing Group.  Audio Routing Groups are valid in a multiparty conversation and are used to establish routes (incoming and outgoing audio from the participant.)  Source is the participant itself and the receivers are a subset of other participants in the multiparty conversation. 

> **Note:** [ConfigureMixer](../api/participant_configureMixer.md) does not involve any routes, it is for the entire call for setting the volume levels for source-receiver combinations.

## Methods

| Method                                                  | Return Type                               | Description                                  |
|:--------------------------------------------------------|:------------------------------------------|:---------------------------------------------|
| [Get audioRoutingGroup](../api/audioRoutingGroup_get.md)| [audioRoutingGroup](audioRoutingGroup.md) | Read properties and relationships of audioRoutingGroup object.|
| [Update](../api/audioroutinggroup_update.md)            | [audioRoutingGroup](audioRoutingGroup.md) | Update receivers list.                       |
| [Delete](../api/audioRoutingGroup_delete.md)            | None                                      | Delete the audio routing group.              |

## Properties

| Property      | Type              | Description                                                          |
| :----------   | :---------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| id            | String            | Read-only.                                                           |
| receivers     | String Collection | List of receiving participant ids.                                   |
| routingMode   | String            | Routing group mode.  Possible values are: `oneToOne`, `multicast`.   |
| sources       | String Collection | List of source participant ids.                                      |

> **Note:** Routing mode determines the restrictions on the sources and receivers. Only the following routing groups are supported.
> - `oneToOne` - sources and receivers have only one participant each.
> - `multicast` - source has one participant but there are multiple receivers. Receivers list may be updated.

> **Note:** If you create many audio routing groups (e.g. a bot per participant), only the audio of the top 4 dominant speakers is forwarded. It means even with customized audio routing group, if the speaker is not loud enough in the main mixer, he/she cannot be heard by the bot even if there is a private audio group just for this speaker and the bot.
