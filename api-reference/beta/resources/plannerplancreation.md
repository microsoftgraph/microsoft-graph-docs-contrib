# plannerPlanCreation resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph

The resources that derive from plannerPlanCreation contain information about the origin of the [plannerPlan](plannerplan.md). Apps do not need to know the origin of the plan to be able to work with it; however, some apps can use the additional information to provide specific experiences around these plans. This is the abstract base type of [plannerExternalPlanSource](plannerExternalPlanSource.md).
