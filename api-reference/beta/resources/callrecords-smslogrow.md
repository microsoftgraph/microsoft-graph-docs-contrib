# smsLogRow resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph.callRecords

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Represents a row of data in the log of a sent or received SMS. Each row maps to one SMS.

Per-country privacy requirements include the obfuscation of the external (not owned by the customer) phone numbers for some countries/regions based on the location of the organization.
For those countries/regions, the three or four last digits of the external phone number are replaced with asterisks (for example, +123 456789***).
