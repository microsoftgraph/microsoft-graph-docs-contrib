# educationResource resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

An abstract type that represents the base class for all education-related resource objects in a system.

Base type of the following resources:
- [educationExcelResource](../resources/educationexcelresource.md)
- [educationExternalResource](../resources/educationexternalresource.md)
- [educationFileResource](../resources/educationfileresource.md)
- [educationLinkResource](../resources/educationlinkresource.md)
- [educationMediaResource](../resources/educationmediaresource.md)
- [educationPowerPointResource](../resources/educationpowerpointresource.md)
- [educationSpeakerProgressResource](../resources/educationspeakerprogressresource.md)
- [educationTeamsAppResource](../resources/educationteamsappresource.md)
- [educationWordResource](../resources/educationwordresource.md)

An **educationResource** is associated with an [assignment](educationassignment.md) and/or [submission](educationsubmission.md), which represents the learning object that is being handed out or handed in. You can't instantiate a resource directly; you must make a subclass that represents the type of resource being used.

This resource stores the common properties across all resource types.

|displayName|String|Display name of resource.|
