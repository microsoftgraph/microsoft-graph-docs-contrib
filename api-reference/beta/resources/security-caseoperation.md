# caseOperation resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph.security

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

An abstract entity that represents a long-running eDiscovery process. It contains a common set of properties that are shared among inheriting entities. Entities that derive from **caseOperation** include:

- [Index operation](../resources/security-ediscoveryindexoperation.md)
- [Hold operation](../resources/security-ediscoveryholdoperation.md)
- [Purge data operation](../resources/security-ediscoverypurgedataoperation.md)
- [Estimate operation](../resources/security-ediscoveryestimateoperation.md)
- [Add to review set operation](../resources/security-ediscoveryaddtoreviewsetoperation.md)
- [Tag operation](../resources/security-ediscoverytagoperation.md)
- [Export operation](../resources/security-ediscoveryexportoperation.md)
- [Search export operation](../resources/security-ediscoverysearchexportoperation.md)

Inherits from [entity](../resources/entity.md).

## Methods
|Method|Return type|Description|
|:---|:---|:---|
|[List case operations](../api/security-ediscoverycase-list-operations.md)|[microsoft.graph.security.caseOperation](../resources/security-caseoperation.md) collection|Get a list of the [caseOperation](../resources/security-caseoperation.md) objects and their properties.|
|[Get case operation by ID](../api/security-caseoperation-get.md)|[microsoft.graph.security.caseOperation](../resources/security-caseoperation.md)|Read the properties and relationships of a [caseOperation](../resources/security-caseoperation.md) object.|

## Properties
|Property|Type|Description|
|:---|:---|:---|
|action|[microsoft.graph.security.caseAction](../resources/security-caseoperation.md#caseaction-values)| The type of action the operation represents. Possible values are: `contentExport`,  `applyTags`, `convertToPdf`, `index`, `estimateStatistics`, `addToReviewSet`, `holdUpdate`, `unknownFutureValue`, `purgeData`, `exportReport`, `exportResult`. Use the `Prefer: include-unknown-enum-members` request header to get the following values from this [evolvable enum](/graph/best-practices-concept#handling-future-members-in-evolvable-enumerations): `purgeData`, `exportReport`, `exportResult`.|
|completedDateTime|DateTimeOffset| The date and time the operation was completed. |
|createdBy|[identitySet](../resources/identityset.md)| The user that created the operation. |
|createdDateTime|DateTimeOffset| The date and time the operation was created. |
|id|String| The ID for the operation. Read-only. |
|percentProgress|Int32| The progress of the operation. |
|resultInfo|[resultInfo](../resources/resultinfo.md)| Contains success and failure-specific result information. |
|status|[microsoft.graph.security.caseOperationStatus](../resources/security-caseoperation.md#caseoperationstatus-values)| The status of the case operation. Possible values are: `notStarted`, `submissionFailed`, `running`, `succeeded`, `partiallySucceeded`, `failed`.|
