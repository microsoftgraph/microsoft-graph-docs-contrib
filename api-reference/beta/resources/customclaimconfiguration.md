# customClaimConfiguration resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Represents a claim configuration that details the conditions and sources of any custom claim. Typically, an attribute or a set of transforms should be provided to source the claim value. In the case where both are provided, the output of the transforms takes priority. If the transform results in no output then the attribute value is used.
