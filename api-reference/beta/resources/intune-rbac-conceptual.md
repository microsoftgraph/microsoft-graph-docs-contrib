Namespace: microsoft.graph

> **Important:** APIs under the /beta version in Microsoft Graph are in preview and are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported.

> **Note:** The Microsoft Graph API for Intune requires an [active Intune license](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=839381) for the tenant.

Intune's role-based access control determines who can perform actions on Intune objects and make changes for managed applications, users and devices.   

Graph resources are available to manage role-based access control in Intune. See the table of content for a list of resources.
