Represents a [Trust Framework](/azure/active-directory-b2c/active-directory-b2c-reference-trustframeworks-defined-ief-custom) policy (also called [custom policy](/azure/active-directory-b2c/active-directory-b2c-overview-custom)) in [Azure Active Directory B2C](/azure/active-directory-b2c/active-directory-b2c-overview). A Trust Framework policy gives full control over the user journeys. Use it to:

* Customize the sign-up and sign-in experiences fully.
* Federate to any SAML, Open ID Connect, or OAuth2 identity provider.
* Integrate with other systems or user data stores by calling REST endpoints.
* Transform claims and customize tokens issued to the relying party application.

For more information, see [Custom policies in Azure Active Directory B2C](/azure/active-directory-b2c/active-directory-b2c-overview-custom).
