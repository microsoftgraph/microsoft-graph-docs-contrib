# mobilityManagementPolicy resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

In Azure AD, a mobility management policy represents an auto-enrollment configuration for a mobility management (MDM or MAM) application. These policies are only applicable to devices based on Windows 10 OS and its derivatives (Surface Hub, Hololens etc.). [Auto-enrollment](/windows/client-management/mdm/azure-ad-and-microsoft-intune-automatic-mdm-enrollment-in-the-new-portal) enables organizations to automatically enroll devices into their chosen mobility management application as part of [Azure AD join](/azure/active-directory/devices/concept-azure-ad-join) or [Azure AD register](/azure/active-directory/devices/concept-azure-ad-register) process on Windows 10 devices.
