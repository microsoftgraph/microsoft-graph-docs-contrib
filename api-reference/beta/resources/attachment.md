# attachment resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

[!INCLUDE [outlooktask-deprecate-sharedfeature](../../includes/outlooktask-deprecate-sharedfeature.md)]

You can add related content to a user [event](../resources/event.md),
[message](../resources/message.md), [Outlook task](../resources/outlooktask.md), or group [post](../resources/post.md) in the form of an attachment. 

Events in group calendars do not support attachments.

Outlook tasks do not support reference attachments.

**attachment** is the base resource for the following derived types of attachments:

* A file ([fileAttachment](../resources/fileattachment.md) resource)
* An item (contact, event or message, represented by an [itemAttachment](../resources/itemattachment.md) resource)
* A link to a file ([referenceAttachment](../resources/referenceattachment.md) resource)

>**Note**: There is a limit to the size of the file or item attachment you can add to under 4 MB. 
>
> However, if you're attaching to a message a file that is between 3MB and 150MB, you can [create an upload session](../api/attachment-createuploadsession.md) and iteratively upload ranges of the file to attach it. See [attach large files to Outlook messages](/graph/outlook-large-attachments) for an example.
