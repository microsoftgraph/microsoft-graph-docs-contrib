## Properties
|Property|Type|Description|
|:---|:---|:---|
|id|String|Key of the entity. Inherited from [deviceConfiguration](../resources/intune-deviceconfig-deviceconfiguration.md)|
|lastModifiedDateTime|DateTimeOffset|DateTime the object was last modified. Inherited from [deviceConfiguration](../resources/intune-deviceconfig-deviceconfiguration.md)|
|roleScopeTagIds|String collection|List of Scope Tags for this Entity instance. Inherited from [deviceConfiguration](../resources/intune-deviceconfig-deviceconfiguration.md)|
