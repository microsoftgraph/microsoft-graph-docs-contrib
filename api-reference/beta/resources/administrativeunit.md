# administrativeUnit resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

An administrative unit provides a conceptual container for User and Group directory objects. Using administrative units, a company administrator can now delegate administrative responsibilities to manage the users and groups contained within or scoped to an administrative unit to a regional or departmental administrator.

This resource supports using [delta query](/graph/delta-query-overview) to track incremental additions, deletions, and updates, by providing a [delta](../api/administrativeunit-delta.md) function.

Let's look at an example. Imagine that Contoso Corp is made up of two divisions - a West Coast Division and an East Coast Division. Directory roles at Contoso are scoped to the entire tenant. Lee, a Contoso company administrator, wants to delegate administrative responsibilities, but scope them to the West Coast Division or the East Coast division.  Lee can create a *West Coast admistrative unit* and place all West Coast users into this administrative unit.  Similarly, Lee can create an *East Coast adminstrative unit*.  Now Lee, can start delegating administrative responsibilities to others, but **scoped** to the new administrative units he's created. Lee places Jennifer in a *helpdesk administrator* role **scoped** to the *West Coast administrative unit*.  This allows Jennifer to reset any user's password, but only if those users are in the *West Coast administrative unit*.  Similarly, Lee places Dave in a *user account administrator* role **scoped** to the *East Coast administrative unit*.  This allows Dave to update users, assign licenses and reset any user's password, but only if those users are in the *East Coast administrative unit*. For a video overview, please see [Introduction to Azure Active Directory Administrative Units](https://channel9.msdn.com/Series/Windows-Azure-Active-Directory/Introduction-to-Azure-Active-Directory-Administrative-Units).

This resource lets you add your own data to custom properties using [extensions](/graph/extensibility-overview).

This topic provides descriptions of the declared properties and navigation properties exposed by the administrativeUnit entity, as well as the operations and functions that can be called on the administrativeUnits resource.
