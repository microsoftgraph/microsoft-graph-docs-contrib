# administrativeUnit resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

An administrative unit provides a conceptual container for user, group, and device directory objects. With administrative units, a company administrator can now delegate administrative responsibilities to manage the users, groups, and devices contained within or scoped to an administrative unit to a regional or departmental administrator. For more information about administrative units, see [Administrative units in Microsoft Entra ID](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/administrative-units).

This resource is an open type that allows other properties to be passed in.

This resource supports:

- Adding your own data to custom properties as [extensions](/graph/extensibility-overview).
- Using [delta query](/graph/delta-query-overview) to track incremental additions, deletions, and updates, by providing a [delta](../api/user-delta.md) function.
- [OData query capabilities](/graph/query-parameters) including `$select`, `$filter`, `$search`, and `$top`. Specific usages are supported only with [Advanced query capabilities](/graph/aad-advanced-queries#group-properties).

> [!NOTE]
> The URL endpoint for calling the **administrativeUnits** API is `/administrativeUnits` in the `beta` endpoint but `/directory/administrativeUnits` in the `v1.0` endpoint.

## Properties

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Specific usage of `$filter` and the `$search` query parameter is supported only when you use the **ConsistencyLevel** header set to `eventual` and `$count`. For more information, see [Advanced query capabilities on directory objects](/graph/aad-advanced-queries#administrative-unit-properties).

| Property.  | Type    |Description|
|:---------------|:--------|:----------|
|description|String|An optional description for the administrative unit. Supports `$filter` (`eq`, `ne`, `in`, `startsWith`), `$search`.|
|displayName|String|Display name for the administrative unit. Maximum length is 256 characters. Supports `$filter` (`eq`, `ne`, `not`, `ge`, `le`, `in`, `startsWith`, and `eq` on `null` values), `$search`, and `$orderby`.|
|id|String|Unique identifier for the administrative unit. Read-only. Supports `$filter` (`eq`).|
|isMemberManagementRestricted|Boolean|`true` if members of this administrative unit should be treated as sensitive, which requires specific permissions to manage. If not set, the default value is `null` and the default behavior is false. Use this property to define administrative units with roles that don't inherit from tenant-level administrators, and where the management of individual member objects is limited to administrators scoped to a restricted management administrative unit. This property is immutable and can't be changed later. <br/><br/> For more information on how to work with restricted management administrative units, see [Restricted management administrative units in Microsoft Entra ID](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/admin-units-restricted-management).|
| membershipRule | String | The dynamic membership rule for the administrative unit. For more information about the rules you can use for dynamic administrative units and dynamic groups, see [Manage rules for dynamic membership groups in Microsoft Entra ID](/entra/identity/users/groups-dynamic-membership). |
| membershipRuleProcessingState | String | Controls whether the dynamic membership rule is actively processed. Set to `On` to activate the dynamic membership rule, or `Paused` to stop updating membership dynamically. |
| membershipType | String | Indicates the membership type for the administrative unit. The possible values are: `dynamic`, `assigned`. If not set, the default value is `null` and the default behavior is assigned. |
| visibility | String | Controls whether the administrative unit and its members are hidden or public. Can be set to `HiddenMembership` or `Public`. If not set, the default value is `null` and the default behavior is public. When set to `HiddenMembership`, only members of the administrative unit can list other members of the administrative unit. |

> [!TIP]
> Directory extensions and associated data are returned by default while schema extensions and associated data returned only on `$select`.

## Relationships
| Relationship | Type    |Description|
|:---------------|:--------|:----------|
|extensions|[extension](extension.md) collection|The collection of open extensions defined for this administrative unit. Nullable.|
|members|[directoryObject](directoryobject.md) collection|Users and groups that are members of this administrative unit. Supports `$expand`.|
|scopedRoleMembers|[scopedRoleMembership](scopedrolemembership.md) collection| Scoped-role members of this administrative unit.|
