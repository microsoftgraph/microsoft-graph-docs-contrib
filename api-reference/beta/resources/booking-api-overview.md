# Use the Microsoft Bookings API in Microsoft Graph for shared bookings

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Microsoft Bookings lets enterprise organization and small business owners manage customer bookings and information with minimal setup. A business owner can create one or more businesses, with each business offering a set of services. The owner can set up staff members, and specify the services that each staff member performs. A customer can book an appointment for a specific service in that business in an online or mobile app. Bookings ensures that the appointment time is kept up-to-date for the business, staff members, and customers involved.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Microsoft Bookings API in Microsoft Graph applies only to shared bookings. The API is not applicable for personal bookings.

Programmatically, a [bookingBusiness](bookingbusiness.md) in the Bookings API involves the following objects:

- One or more [bookingStaffMember](bookingstaffmember.md) objects
- One or more [bookingService](bookingservice.md) objects
- A set of [bookingAppointment](bookingappointment.md) instances
- A set of [bookingCustomer](bookingcustomer.md) objects

## Using the Bookings REST API

Walk through the following steps before booking customer appointments for a business the first time. Make sure you provide the appropriate [access tokens](/graph/auth/) for the corresponding operations.

1. Make sure the business has an [Microsoft 365 Business Premium](https://products.office.com/business/office-365-business-premium) subscription.
2. Create a new **bookingBusiness** by sending a POST operation to the entity set. At minimum, you should specify a name for the new business that customers will see:
<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
POST https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/bookingBusinesses
Authorization: Bearer {access token}
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "displayName":"Contoso"
}
```
Use the **id** property of the new **bookingBusiness** returned in the POST response to continue to [customize](../api/bookingbusiness-update.md) business settings, and add staff members and services for the business.

3. Add individual staff members for the business:
<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
POST https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/bookingBusinesses/{id}/staffMembers
Authorization: Bearer {access token}
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "displayName":"Dana Swope",
    "emailAddress": "danas@contoso.com",
    "role": "externalGuest"
}
```
4. Define each service offered by the business:
<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
POST https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/bookingBusinesses/{id}/services
Authorization: Bearer {access token}
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "displayName":"Bento"
}
```
5. Publish the scheduling page for the business, to let customers and business operators start booking appointments:
<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
POST https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/bookingBusinesses/{id}/publish
Authorization: Bearer {access token}
```

In general, to list all the booking businesses in the Microsoft 365 tenant:
<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
GET https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/bookingBusinesses
Authorization: Bearer {access token}
```
