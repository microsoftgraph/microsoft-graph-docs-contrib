# servicePrincipal resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Represents an instance of an application in a directory. Inherits from [directoryObject](directoryobject.md).

This resource supports using [delta query](/graph/delta-query-overview) to track incremental additions, deletions, and updates, by providing a [delta](../api/serviceprincipal-delta.md) function. This resource is an open type that allows other properties to be passed in.
