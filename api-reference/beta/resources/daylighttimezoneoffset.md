# daylightTimeZoneOffset resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Specifies when a time zone switches from standard time to daylight saving time.

For example, if a time zone is specified with the following properties:

- **bias** is 300
- **daylightBias** is -100
- **dayOccurrence** is 4
- **dayOfWeek** is "sunday"
- **month** is 5
- **time** is 02:00:00
_ **year** is 0
That means the time during daylight saving time is +300-100=200 minutes ahead of UTC. The time zone transition from
daylight saving time to standard occurs at 2 AM on the fourth Sunday of May, every year.


## Properties
| Property	   | Type	|Description|
