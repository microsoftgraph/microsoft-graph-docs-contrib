# accessReviewQueryScope resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]
[!INCLUDE [accessreviews-disclaimer-v2](../../includes/accessreviews-disclaimer-v2.md)]

An accessReviewQueryScope object defines what will be reviewed in an [access review](../resources/accessreviewsv2-root.md). To scope an access review to inactive users, see [accessReviewInactiveUserQueryScope](../resources/accessreviewinactiveusersqueryscope.md). 

Inherits from [accessReviewScope](../resources/accessreviewscope.md).

## Properties
|Property|Type|Description|
|:---|:---|:---|
|query|String|The query representing what will be reviewed in an access review.|
|queryRoot|String|In the scenario where reviewers need to be specified dynamically, this property is used to indicate the relative source of the query. This property is only required if a relative query is specified. For example, `./manager`.|
|queryType|String|Indicates the type of query. Types include `MicrosoftGraph` and `ARM`.|

Specifying the **@odata.type** type property with the value `#microsoft.graph.accessReviewQueryScope` is highly recommended. For more about configuration options for **scope** using **accessReviewQueryScope**, see [Configure the scope of your access review definition using the Microsoft Graph API](/graph/accessreviews-scope-concept).
