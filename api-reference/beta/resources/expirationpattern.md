# expirationPattern resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

In [Azure AD entitlement management](entitlementmanagement-root.md), an access package assignment request is created by a user who wants to obtain an access package assignment. This request can include a schedule for when the user would like to have an assignment.  An access package assignment that results from such a request also has a schedule.  The expiration field of a [requestSchedule](requestschedule.md) indicates when the access package assignment should expire.

## Properties

| Property     | Type        | Description |
|:-------------|:------------|:------------|
|endDateTime|DateTimeOffset|Timestamp of date and time information using ISO 8601 format and is always in UTC time. For example, midnight UTC on Jan 1, 2014 is `2014-01-01T00:00:00Z`.|
|duration|Duration|The requestor's desired duration of access represented in ISO 8601 format for durations. For example, PT3H refers to three hours.  If specified in a request, **endDateTime** should not be present and the **type** property should be set to `afterDuration`.|
|type|expirationPatternType|The requestor's desired expiration pattern type.|
