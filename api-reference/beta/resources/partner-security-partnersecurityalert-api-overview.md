# Use the partner security alert API in Microsoft Graph (preview)

Namespace: microsoft.graph.partner.security

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

As a partner in the Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) program, you're responsible for your customer's Azure consumption; therefore, it's important that you're aware of any anomalous usage in your customer's Azure subscriptions. Use Microsoft Graph [partner security alert](../resources/partner-security-partnersecurityalert.md) API to detect patterns of fraudulent activities and misuse in Azure resources to help reduce your exposure to online transaction risks. Mitigating and responding to the alerts within 24 hours can significantly minimize the financial loss that your customers might incur during the compromise.

For information about how to contain a compromise on your customer's tenant or Azure subscriptions, see [What additional steps can you take to lower the risk of compromise](/partner-center/azure-fraud-notification#what-additional-steps-can-you-take-to-lower-the-risk-of-compromise).

The partner security alert API is defined in the OData subnamespace `microsoft.graph.partners.security`.
