# cloudPcFrontLineServicePlan resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Represents a service plan that provides an allotment of three Cloud PCs for the admin to provision for up to three users, but can't be assigned to a specific user. This service plan enables the service to create a concept of a time-share across these provisioned users, where customers can deploy a larger number of users. Windows 365 enforces a limit on active users at a given time, effectively creating an innovative way to provide the personalized experience of a Cloud PC along with the improved economics of sharing.
