# Microsoft Entra Health monitoring API overview

Namespace: microsoft.graph.healthMonitoring

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

The Microsoft Entra Health monitoring alerts APIs allow you to view anomalous usage patterns for your tenant on business-critical identity scenarios and receive alert notifications. The API is built to fire alerts based on monitoring the health metric streams in [serviceActivity APIs](../resources/serviceactivity.md). These alerts contain information about the type, date, and impact of the anomalous usage patterns and allow you to investigate and remediate issues that you find.
