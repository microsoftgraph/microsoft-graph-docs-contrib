# aospDeviceOwnerDeviceConfiguration resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph

> **Important:** Microsoft supports Intune /beta APIs, but they are subject to more frequent change. Microsoft recommends using version v1.0 when possible. Check an API's availability in version v1.0 using the Version selector.

> **Note:** The Microsoft Graph API for Intune requires an [active Intune license](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=839381) for the tenant.

This topic provides descriptions of the declared methods, properties and relationships exposed by the AndroidDeviceOwnerAOSPDeviceConfiguration resource.
