# Use the Microsoft Search API to index data

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

You can use Microsoft Graph to add custom items to search results in the [Microsoft Search](/microsoftsearch/overview-microsoft-search) experience.

Requests to index data are performed on behalf of an application without the presence of a signed-in user, identified using an [access token with application permission](/graph/auth-v2-service).

[!INCLUDE [search-api-preview](../../includes/search-api-preview-signup.md)]

## Common use cases

The use cases for the APIs in this section involve building [Microsoft Graph connectors](/microsoftsearch/connectors-overview), which involves the following primary steps:

1. [Create a connection](../api/external-post-connections.md) to an external data source.
2. [Create and register a schema](../api/externalconnection-post-schema.md) that describes the type and how to index the external data.
3. [Index the data](../api/externalconnection-put-items.md) as an external item.

## Known limitations

The following are current knownlimitations:

- Organizations are limited to a maximum of 10 connections.
- Only Azure Active Directory identities are supported.
- You can create only four `externalItem` resources items per second.
- An application is limited to four concurrent operations on a connection.
- Connections have a capacity limit of 700,000 items or ~70 GB of data.
- Maximum size of an `externalItem` entity is 4 MB.
- Sorting results is not supported.
- Result ranking is best effort.
