# educationAssignmentResource resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Represents a wrapper object that stores the resources associated with an assignment. The wrapper adds the **distributeForStudentWork** property and indicates that this resource is copied to the student submission. If the object isn't copied, each student sees a link to the resource on the assignment. The student won't be able to update this resource. This is a handout from the teacher to the student with nothing to be turned in. If the resource is distributed, each student receives a copy of this resource in the resource list of their submission. Each student is able to modify their copy and submit it for grading.
