# calendarPermission resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

The permissions of a user with whom the calendar has been shared or delegated in an Outlook client.

List, create, get, update, and delete of calendar permissions is supported on behalf of only the calendar owner.

Getting the calendar permissions of a calendar on behalf of a share recipient or delegate returns an empty calendar permissions collection.

Once a share recipient or delegate has been set up for a calendar, you can [update](../api/calendarpermission-update.md) only the **role** property to change the permissions of a share recipient or delegate. You can't **update** the **allowedRoles**, **emailAddress**, **isInsideOrganization**, or **isRemovable** property. To change these properties, you should [delete](../api/calendarpermission-delete.md) the corresponding **calendarPermission** object and create another share recipient or delegate in an Outlook client.

## Methods
