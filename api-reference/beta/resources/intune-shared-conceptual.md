# Shared resources in Microsoft Intune

Namespace: microsoft.graph

> **Important:** APIs under the /beta version in Microsoft Graph are in preview and are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported.

> **Note:** The Microsoft Graph API for Intune requires an [active Intune license](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=839381) for the tenant.

These endpoints are used in multiple Microsoft Graph API for Intune workflows.  The intent, purpose, and permissions required to use a given resource varies according to the specific workflow and context of the underlying call.  In addition, certain methods, properties, and actions are supported only for specific workflows.

The following Graph resources are shared between Intune workflows:
