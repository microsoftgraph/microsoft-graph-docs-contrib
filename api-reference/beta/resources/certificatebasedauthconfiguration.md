# certificateBasedAuthConfiguration resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Certificate-based authentication enables you to be authenticated by Microsoft Entra ID with a client certificate on a Windows, Android, or iOS device when connecting your Exchange Online account to:

- Microsoft mobile applications such as Outlook and Word
- Exchange ActiveSync (EAS) clients

Configuring this feature eliminates the need to enter a username and password combination into certain mail and Microsoft Office applications on your mobile device.

Certificate-based authentication configuration is provided through a collection of certificate authorities. The certificate authorities are used to establish a trusted certificate chain which enables clients to be authenticated by Microsoft Entra ID with a client certificate.

>[!NOTE]
>Administrators are highly recommended to configure the new scalable platform for [PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) based store](certificatebasedauthpki.md). This new PKI based CA store has higher limits for the number of CAs that supports up to 250CAs as well as the size of up to 8KB for each CA file and also supports new functionality such as issuer hints.
