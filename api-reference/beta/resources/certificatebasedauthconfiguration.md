# certificateBasedAuthConfiguration resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Certificate-based authentication enables you to be authenticated by Azure Active Directory with a client certificate on a Windows, Android, or iOS device when connecting your Exchange Online account to:

- Microsoft mobile applications such as Outlook and Word
- Exchange ActiveSync (EAS) clients

Configuring this feature eliminates the need to enter a username and password combination into certain mail and Microsoft Office applications on your mobile device.

Certificate-based authentication configuration is provided through a collection of certificate authorities. The certificate authorities are used to establish a trusted certificate chain which enables clients to be authenticated by Azure Active Directory with a client certificate.
