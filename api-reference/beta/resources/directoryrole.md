# directoryRole resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Represents an Azure AD directory role. Azure AD directory roles are also known as *administrator roles*. For more information about directory (administrator) roles, see [Assigning administrator roles in Azure AD](/azure/active-directory/users-groups-roles/directory-assign-admin-roles). With the Microsoft Graph, you can assign users to directory roles to grant them the permissions of the target role. To read a directory role or update its members, it must first be activated in the tenant. Only the Company Administrators directory role is activated by default. To activate other available directory roles, you send a POST request with the ID of the [directoryRoleTemplate](directoryroletemplate.md) on which the directory role is based. [List directory role templates](../api/directoryroletemplate-list.md) to get all the other available directory roles. Inherits from [directoryObject](directoryobject.md).

By default, directory roles are scoped to be tenant-wide.  However, directory roles (currently only the *user account admin* and *helpdesk admin*) may also be scoped to [administrative units](administrativeunit.md).

This resource supports:

- Using [delta query](/graph/delta-query-overview) to track incremental additions, deletions, and updates, by providing a [delta](../api/directoryrole-delta.md) function.
