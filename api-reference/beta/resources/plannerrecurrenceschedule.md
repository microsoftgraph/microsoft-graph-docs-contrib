# plannerRecurrenceSchedule resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Represents the schedule for recurrence of a [Planner task](plannertask.md) in Microsoft 365. Currently, **plannerRecurrenceSchedule** includes a recurrence pattern definition (**pattern**), a start date for that pattern (**patternStartDateTime**), and a system-generated property that indicates the next occurrence date (**nextOccurrenceDateTime**). To define a recurrence schedule, clients must specify the **pattern** and **patternStartDateTime**; the service calculates the **nextOccurrenceDateTime**.

For more details, see [Configuring task recurrence in Planner](/graph/planner-task-recurrence-overview).

## Properties

|Property|Type|Description|
|:---|:---|:---|
|nextOccurrenceDateTime|DateTimeOffset|The next date for this **schedule**. When a new task is instantiated to continue the recurrence series, this date is used for the **dueDateTime** of the new **plannerTask**. Auto-generated by the service. The Timestamp type represents date and time information using ISO 8601 format and is always in UTC time. For example, midnight UTC on Jan 1, 2014 is `2014-01-01T00:00:00Z`. Read-only.|
|pattern|[recurrencePattern](../resources/recurrencepattern.md)|The pattern for recurrence. Required.|
|patternStartDateTime|DateTimeOffset|The start date for the recurrence pattern. The Timestamp type represents date and time information using ISO 8601 format and is always in UTC time. For example, midnight UTC on Jan 1, 2014 is `2014-01-01T00:00:00Z`. Required.|
