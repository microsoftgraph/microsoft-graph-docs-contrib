# accessReviewScope resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

[!INCLUDE [accessreviews-disclaimer-v2](../../includes/accessreviews-disclaimer-v2.md)]

The **accessReviewScope** defines what entities are reviewed in an [accessReviewScheduleDefinition](accessreviewscheduledefinition.md). It's an abstract type that is inherited by [accessReviewQueryScope](accessreviewqueryscope.md), [principalResourceMembershipsScope](principalresourcemembershipsscope.md), and [accessReviewReviewerScope](accessreviewreviewerscope.md). 

For **scope** property on an [accessReviewScheduleDefinition](accessreviewscheduledefinition.md) see [accessReviewQueryScope](accessreviewqueryscope.md) and [principalResourceMembershipsScope](principalresourcemembershipsscope.md).

For **reviewers** property on an [accessReviewScheduleDefinition](accessreviewscheduledefinition.md) see [accessReviewReviewerScope](accessreviewreviewerscope.md).

Specifying the OData type in the **scope** is highly recommended for all types but required for [principalResourceMembershipsScope](principalresourcemembershipsscope.md) and [accessReviewInactiveUserQueryScope](../resources/accessreviewinactiveusersqueryscope.md).
