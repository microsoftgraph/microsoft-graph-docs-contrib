# insightsSettings resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Represents settings to calculate and manage the display or programmatic return of a specific type of insights in an organization. The insights can be contact insights, item insights, meeting hours insights, or people insights.

Contact insights represent intelligent suggestions to organize user contacts in Microsoft 365. Programmatically, user contacts are represented by the [contact](contact.md) resource. An example of a contact insight is merge suggestions for duplicate contacts, available for end users in Outlook.

Item insights and [meeting hours insights](https://support.microsoft.com/office/suggested-meeting-hours-0613d113-d7c1-4faa-bb11-c8ba30a78ef1) represent relationships between users and items such as documents, sites, and other content types in Microsoft 365. Programmatically, they're represented by the [itemInsights](iteminsights.md) resource. You can get documents that are [shared](../api/insights-list-shared.md) with a user, [trending](../api/insights-list-trending.md) around a user, or [used](../api/insights-list-used.md) by a user. You can use **insightsSettings** to [customize the privacy settings for calculating, displaying, or returning item insights in an organization](/graph/insights-customize-item-insights-privacy).

People insights represent connections of people who are relevant to or work with one another based on their public relationships. Programmatically, individual people are represented by the [person](person.md) resource. You can [use the people API to get people insights](/graph/people-insights-overview). You can use **insightsSettings** to [customize the privacy settings for displaying or returning people insights](/graph/insights-customize-people-insights-privacy).

In contrast, for item insights and [meeting hours insights](https://support.microsoft.com/office/update-your-meeting-hours-using-the-profile-card-0613d113-d7c1-4faa-bb11-c8ba30a78ef1), you can also manage their calculation and visibility at a user level by using the [userInsightsSettings](userinsightssettings.md) resource.
