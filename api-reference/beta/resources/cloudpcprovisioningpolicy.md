The template can contain custom text and replacement tokens, including `%USERNAME:x%` and `%RAND:x%`, which represent the user's name and a randomly generated number, respectively. For example, `CPC-%USERNAME:4%-%RAND:5%` means that the name of the Cloud PC starts with `CPC-`, followed by a four-character username, a `-` character, and then five random characters.

| shared             | Indicates provisioning policy when a dedicated Cloud PC is provisioned for each user in the assignment group. Users are always connected to the the same Cloud PC, however Cloud PC availability is limited by the total number of active sessions. Starting from April 30, 2027, this property will no longer be supported and will be marked as deprecated. Please use sharedByUser instead.             |
| unknownFutureValue | Evolvable enumeration sentinel value. Do not use.                                                                                           |
| sharedByUser     | Indicates provisioning policy when a dedicated Cloud PC is provisioned for each user in the assignment group. Users are always connected to the the same Cloud PC, however Cloud PC availability is limited by the total number of active sessions.                                                  |
| sharedByEntraGroup   | Indicates provisioning policy associated with Cloud PCs shared by an Entra (Azure AD) group. When a shared Cloud PC is provisioned and available for any user in the Entra ID assignment group to connect to. Users may be connected to a different Cloud PC on each connection and availability is limited by the number of Cloud PC's provisioned.                                     |

## Relationships

|Relationship|Type|Description|
|:---|:---|:---|
