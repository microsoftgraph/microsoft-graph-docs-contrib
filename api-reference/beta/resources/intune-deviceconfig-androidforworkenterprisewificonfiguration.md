# androidForWorkEnterpriseWiFiConfiguration resource type

> **Important:** APIs under the / beta version in Microsoft Graph are in preview and are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported.

> **Note:** Using the Microsoft Graph APIs to configure Intune controls and policies still requires that the Intune service is [correctly licensed](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=839381) by the customer.

By providing the configurations in this profile you can instruct the Android for Work device to connect to desired Wi-Fi endpoint. By specifying the authentication method and security types expected by Wi-Fi endpoint you can make the Wi-Fi connection seamless for end user.
