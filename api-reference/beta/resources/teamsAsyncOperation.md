# teamsAsyncOperation resource type

> **Important:** APIs under the /beta version in Microsoft Graph are in preview and are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported.

A Microsoft Teams async operation is an operation that transcends the lifetime of a single API request. These operations are long-running or too expensive to complete within the timeframe of their originating request.
