## Remarks

ItemActivity is currently only available on SharePoint and OneDrive for Business.

The actions that took place within an activity are detailed in the **action** property.
Below are the actions that are available today.
New actions may get logged in the future, so make sure your app is tolerant of handling an **itemActivity** without any actions that your app understands.
