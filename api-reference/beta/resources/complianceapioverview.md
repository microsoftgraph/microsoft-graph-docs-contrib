## Next steps

The Microsoft Compliance Security API can open up new ways for you to engage with different security solutions from Microsoft and partners. Follow these steps to get started:


- Drill down into [alerts](alert.md), [tiIndicator](tiindicator.md) (preview), [securityAction](securityaction.md) (preview), [secureScore](securescores.md), and [secureScoreControlProfiles](securescorecontrolprofiles.md).
- Try the API in the [Graph Explorer](https://developer.microsoft.com/graph/graph-explorer). Under **Sample Queries**, choose **show more samples** and set the Security category to **on**.
- Try [subscribing to and receiving notifications](/graph/webhooks) on entity changes.
