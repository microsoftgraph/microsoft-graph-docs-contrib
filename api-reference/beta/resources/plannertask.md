# plannerTask resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Represents a planner task in Microsoft 365. A planner task is contained in a [plan](plannerplan.md) and can be assigned to a [bucket](plannerbucket.md) in a plan. Each task object has a [details](plannertaskdetails.md) object that can contain more information about the task. For more information about relationships between group, plan, and task, see [Use the planner REST API](planner-overview.md).
