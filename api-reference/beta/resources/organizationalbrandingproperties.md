# organizationalBrandingProperties resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

An abstract type that exposes properties for configuring an organization's branding.

Organizations can customize their Microsoft Entra sign-in pages that appear when users sign in to their organization's tenant-specific apps, or when Microsoft Entra ID identifies the user's tenant from their username. A developer can also read the company's branding information and customize their app experience to tailor it specifically for the signed-in user using their company's branding.

You can't change your original configuration's language as represented by the [organizationalBranding](organizationalbranding.md) object. However, companies can add different branding based on locale. For language-specific branding, see the [organizationalBrandingLocalization](organizationalbrandinglocalization.md) object.

>[!NOTE]
>Adding custom branding requires you to have either Microsoft Entra ID P1 or P2, Premium 2, or Office 365 (for Office 365 apps) licenses. For more information about licensing and editions, see [Sign up for Microsoft Entra ID P1 or P2](/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-get-started-premium).
>
>Microsoft Entra ID P1 or P2 editions are available for customers in China using the worldwide instance of Microsoft Entra ID. Microsoft Entra ID P1 or P2 editions aren't currently supported in the Azure service operated by 21Vianet in China. For more information, talk to us using the [Microsoft Entra Forum](https://feedback.azure.com/forums/169401-azure-active-directory/).
