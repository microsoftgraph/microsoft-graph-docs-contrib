|id|String| The ID for the operation. Read-only. Inherited from [caseOperation](../resources/security-caseoperation.md).|
|indexedItemCount|Int64|The estimated count of items for the **search** that matched the content query.|
|indexedItemsSize|Int64|The estimated size of items for the **search** that matched the content query.|
|mailboxCount|Int32|The number of mailboxes that had search hits.|
|percentProgress|Int32|The progress of the operation. Read-only. Inherited from [caseOperation](../resources/security-caseoperation.md).|
|resultInfo|[resultInfo](../resources/resultinfo.md)|Contains success and failure-specific result information. Inherited from [caseOperation](../resources/security-caseoperation.md).|
|siteCount|Int32|The number of mailboxes that had search hits.|
|statisticsOptions|[microsoft.graph.security.statisticsOptions](#statisticsoptions-values)|The options to generate statistics. Possible values are: `includeRefiners`, `includeQueryStats`, `includeUnindexedStats`, `advancedIndexing`, `locationsWithoutHits`, `unknownFutureValue`.|
|status|microsoft.graph.security.caseOperationStatus| The status of the case operation. Possible values are: `notStarted`, `submissionFailed`, `running`, `succeeded`, `partiallySucceeded`, `failed`. Inherited from [caseOperation](../resources/security-caseoperation.md).|
