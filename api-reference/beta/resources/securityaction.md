# securityAction resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Take immediate action to defend against threats using the Microsoft Graph Security securityAction entity. When a security analyst discovers a new indicator, such as a malicious file, URL, domain, or IP address, protection can be instantly enabled in your Microsoft security solutions. Invoke an action for a specific provider, see all actions taken, and cancel an action if needed. Try security actions with [Windows Defender ATP](/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-atp/windows-defender-advanced-threat-protection) to block malicious activity on your Windows endpoints using properties seen in alerts or identified during investigations.

  > **Note:** Currently security actions only support application permissions.
