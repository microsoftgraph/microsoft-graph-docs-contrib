# cloudPcBulkResize resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Represents the entity that performs a bulk resize action. When IT administrators want to upgrade or downgrade Cloud PC devices, they can use this API to trigger a resize remote action for the Cloud PC. This API requires a parameter that specifies the target service plan ID that indicates the configuration to which the Cloud PC should be resized.
