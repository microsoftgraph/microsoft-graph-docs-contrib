## Properties

| Property     | Type        | Description |
|:-------------|:------------|:------------|
|authenticationStrength|[authenticationStrength](authenticationstrength.md)| The custom authentication strength enforced in a Conditional Access policy.|
|conditionsNotSatisfied|conditionalAccessConditions|Refers to the conditional access policy conditions that are not satisfied. The possible values are: `none`, `application`, `users`, `devicePlatform`, `location`, `clientType`, `signInRisk`, `userRisk`, `time`, `deviceState`, `client`,`ipAddressSeenByAzureAD`,`ipAddressSeenByResourceProvider`,`unknownFutureValue`,`servicePrincipals`,`servicePrincipalRisk`. Note that you must use the `Prefer: include-unknown-enum-members` request header to get the following values in this [evolvable enum](/graph/best-practices-concept#handling-future-members-in-evolvable-enumerations): `servicePrincipals`,`servicePrincipalRisk`.|
|conditionsSatisfied|conditionalAccessConditions|Refers to the conditional access policy conditions that are satisfied. The possible values are: `none`, `application`, `users`, `devicePlatform`, `location`, `clientType`, `signInRisk`, `userRisk`, `time`, `deviceState`, `client`,`ipAddressSeenByAzureAD`,`ipAddressSeenByResourceProvider`,`unknownFutureValue`,`servicePrincipals`,`servicePrincipalRisk`. Note that you must use the `Prefer: include-unknown-enum-members` request header to get the following values in this [evolvable enum](/graph/best-practices-concept#handling-future-members-in-evolvable-enumerations): `servicePrincipals`,`servicePrincipalRisk`.|
|displayName|String|Name of the conditional access policy.|
|enforcedGrantControls|String collection|Refers to the grant controls enforced by the conditional access policy (example: “Require multi-factor authentication”).|
|enforcedSessionControls|String collection|Refers to the session controls enforced by the conditional access policy (example: “Require app enforced controls”).|
|excludeRulesSatisfied|[conditionalAccessRuleSatisfied](conditionalaccessrulesatisfied.md) collection|List of key-value pairs containing each matched exclude condition in the conditional access policy. Example: `[{"devicePlatform" : "DevicePlatform"}]` means the policy didn’t apply, because the DevicePlatform condition was a match.|
|id|String|Identifier of the conditional access policy.|
|includeRulesSatisfied|[conditionalAccessRuleSatisfied](conditionalaccessrulesatisfied.md) collection|List of key-value pairs containing each matched include condition in the conditional access policy. Example: `[{ "application" : "AllApps"}, {"users": "Group"}]`, meaning Application condition was a match because AllApps are included *and* Users condition was a match because the user was part of the included Group rule.|
|result|appliedConditionalAccessPolicyResult| Indicates the result of the CA policy that was triggered. Possible values are: `success`, `failure`, `notApplied` (Policy isn't applied because policy conditions were not met),`notEnabled` (This is due to the policy in disabled state), `unknown`, `unknownFutureValue`, `reportOnlySuccess`, `reportOnlyFailure`, `reportOnlyNotApplied`, `reportOnlyInterrupted`. Note that you must use the `Prefer: include-unknown-enum-members` request header to get the following values in this [evolvable enum](/graph/best-practices-concept#handling-future-members-in-evolvable-enumerations): `reportOnlySuccess`, `reportOnlyFailure`, `reportOnlyNotApplied`, `reportOnlyInterrupted`.|
|sessionControlsNotSatisfied|String collection|Refers to the session controls that a sign-in activity did not satisfy. (Example: `Application enforced Restrictions`).|
