# expediteSettings resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph.windowsUpdates

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Represents settings for expediting the deployment of content.

The [catalog content](../resources/windowsupdates-qualityupdatecatalogentry.md) has the property **isExpeditable** set to `true` if it can be expedited. If an attempt is made to create a deployment tagged with **isExpedited** set to `true` but the content has **isExpeditable** set to `false`, then the operation might return a `400 Bad Request` response code. For more information, see [Deploy an expedited quality update using Windows Autopatch](/graph/docs/concepts/windowsupdates-deploy-expedited-update.md).

An expedite readiness test is an expedited deployment that delivers no content to the device. The purpose of designating an expedited deployment as a readiness test is to ensure that the device meets the prerequisites for a successful expedited quality update deployment. An attempt that is made to create a deployment with **isExpedited** set to `false` and **isReadinessTest** set to `true` returns a `400 Bad Request` response code.
