# permissionScope resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Represents the definition of a [delegated permission](/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-permissions-and-consent#permission-types).

Delegated permissions can be requested by client applications needing an access token to the API which defined the permissions. Delegated permissions can be requested [dynamically](/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-permissions-and-consent#requesting-individual-user-consent), using the `scopes` parameter in an authorization request to the Microsoft identity platform, or [statically](/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-permissions-and-consent#the-default-scope), through the **requiredResourceAccess** collection on the [application](application.md) object.

## Properties

| Property | Type | Description |
|:---------------|:--------|:----------|
|adminConsentDescription|String|A description of the delegated permissions, intended to be read by an administrator granting the permission on behalf of all users. This text appears in tenant-wide admin consent experiences.|
|adminConsentDisplayName|String|The permission's title, intended to be read by an administrator granting the permission on behalf of all users.|
|id|Guid|Unique delegated permission identifier inside the collection of delegated permissions defined for a resource application.|
|isEnabled|Boolean|When creating or updating a permission, this property must be set to **true** (which is the default). To delete a permission, this property must first be set to **false**.  At that point, in a subsequent call, the permission may be removed.|
|type|String|Specifies whether this delegated permission should be considered safe for non-admin users to consent to on behalf of themselves, or whether an administrator should be required for consent to the permissions. This will be the default behavior, but each customer can choose to customize the behavior in their organization (by allowing, restricting or limiting user consent to this delegated permission.)|
|userConsentDescription|String|A description of the delegated permissions, intended to be read by a user granting the permission on their own behalf. This text appears in consent experiences where the user is consenting only on behalf of themselves.|
|userConsentDisplayName|String|A title for the permission, intended to be read by a user granting the permission on their own behalf. This text appears in consent experiences where the user is consenting only on behalf of themselves.|
|value|String|Specifies the value to include in the `scp` (scope) claim in access tokens. Must not exceed 120 characters in length. Allowed characters are `:` `!` `#` `$` `%` `&` `'` `(` `)` `*` `+` `,` `-` `.` `/` `:` `;` <code>&lt;</code> `=` <code>&gt;</code> `?` `@` `[` `]` `^` `+` `_` <code>&#96;</code> `{` <code>&#124;</code> `}` `~`, as well as characters in the ranges `0-9`, `A-Z` and `a-z`. Any other character, including the space character, are not allowed. May not begin with `.`.|
