> **Important:** Microsoft supports Intune /beta APIs, but they are subject to more frequent change. Microsoft recommends using version v1.0 when possible. Check an API's availability in version v1.0 using the Version selector.

BIOS configuration and other settings provides customers the ability to configure hardware/bios settings on the enrolled Windows 10/11 Entra ID joined devices by uploading a configuration file generated with their OEM tool (e.g. Dell Command tool). A BIOS configuration policy can be assigned to multiple devices, allowing admins to remotely control a device's hardware properties (e.g. enable Secure Boot) from the Intune Portal. Supported for Dell only at this time.

## Properties
|Property|Type|Description|
|:---|:---|:---|
|id|String|The unique identifier of the hardware BIOS configuration profile for the enrolled devices. This id is and is autogenerated and assigned when new hardware BIOS configuration profile is created. This distinguishes profiles from each other and cannot be null. Returned by default. Read-Only.|
|version|Int32|The version of the hardware configuration (E.g. 1, 2, 3 ...). This is incremented after a change to the BIOS configuration profile's settings file name (FileName property), settings file content (ConfigurationFileContent property), or the PerDevicePasswordDisabled property. Read-Only.|
|displayName|String|The name of the hardware BIOS configuration profile. It serves as user-friendly name to identify hardware BIOS configuration profiles. Max length is 150 characters. Required. Read-Only.|
|description|String|The description of the hardware configuration. Use this to provide context, purpose, applications, etc of the BIOS configuration profile for your organization's admins. Max length is 1000 characters. Optional.|
|createdDateTime|DateTimeOffset|The date and time  of when the BIOS configuration profile was created. The value cannot be modified and is automatically populated when the device is enrolled. The Timestamp type represents date and time information using ISO 8601 format and is always in UTC time. For example, midnight UTC on Jan 1, 2014 would look like this: '2014-01-01T00:00:00Z'. Returned by default. Read-Only. This property is read-only.|
|lastModifiedDateTime|DateTimeOffset|The date and time  of when the BIOS configuration profile was last modified. The value cannot be modified and is automatically populated when the device is enrolled. The Timestamp type represents date and time information using ISO 8601 format and is always in UTC time. For example, midnight UTC on Jan 1, 2014 would look like this: '2014-01-01T00:00:00Z'. Returned by default. Read-Only. Read-Only. This property is read-only.|
|fileName|String|The file name for the BIOS configuration profile's ConfigurationFileContent. Max length is 150 characters. Required.|
|configurationFileContent|Binary|The file content contains custom hardware settings that will be applied to the assigned devices' BIOS. Max allowed file size is 5KB. Represented as bytes. Required.|
|hardwareConfigurationFormat|[hardwareConfigurationFormat](../resources/intune-deviceconfig-hardwareconfigurationformat.md)|The OEM type associated with BIOS configuration profile's custom hardware settings. All devices that adheres to profile must be from the same selected OEM. Possible values are Dell, Surface, and Surface dock. Required. Possible values are: `dell`, `surface`, `surfaceDock`.|
|roleScopeTagIds|String collection|A list of unique Scope Tag IDs associated with the hardware configuration. Optional.|
|perDevicePasswordDisabled|Boolean|When TRUE, indicates whether the policy-assigned devices' passwords are disabled. When FALSE, indicates they are enabled. Default is FALSE. Required.|

## Relationships
|Relationship|Type|Description|
|:---|:---|:---|
|assignments|[hardwareConfigurationAssignment](../resources/intune-deviceconfig-hardwareconfigurationassignment.md) collection|A list of the Entra user group ids that hardware configuration will be applied to. Only security groups and Office 365 Groups are supported. Optional.|
|runSummary|[hardwareConfigurationRunSummary](../resources/intune-deviceconfig-hardwareconfigurationrunsummary.md)|A summary of the results from an attempt to configure hardware settings. Read-Only.|
|deviceRunStates|[hardwareConfigurationDeviceState](../resources/intune-deviceconfig-hardwareconfigurationdevicestate.md) collection|List of run states for the hardware configuration across all devices. Read-Only.|
|userRunStates|[hardwareConfigurationUserState](../resources/intune-deviceconfig-hardwareconfigurationuserstate.md) collection|List of run states for the hardware configuration across all users. Read-Only.|
