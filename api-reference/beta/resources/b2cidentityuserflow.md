# b2cIdentityUserFlow resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Represents a user flow within an Azure Active Directory B2C tenant.

To help you set up the most common identity tasks for your applications, Azure Active Directory B2C includes predefined, configurable policies called [user flows](/azure/active-directory-b2c/user-flow-overview). A user flow lets you determine how users interact with your application when they do things like sign in, sign up, edit a profile, or reset a password. You can create many user flows of different types in your tenant and use them in your applications as needed. With user flows, you can control the following capabilities:

- Account types used for sign-in, such as social accounts like a Facebook or local account
- Attributes to be collected from the consumer, such as first name, postal code, and shoe size
- Azure Multi-Factor Authentication
- Customization of the user interface
- Information that the application receives in the token

## Properties

|Property|Type|Description|
|:---------------|:--------|:----------|
|id|String|The name of the user flow. This is a required value and is immutable after it's created. The name will be prefixed with the value of `B2C_1_` after creation.|
|userFlowType|userFlowType|The [type of user flow](/azure/active-directory-b2c/user-flow-versions). The supported values for **userFlowType** are: `signUp`, `signIn`, `signUpOrSignIn`, `passwordReset`, `profileUpdate`, `resourceOwner`.|
|userFlowTypeVersion|Single|The version of the user flow.|
|isLanguageCustomizationEnabled|Boolean|The property that determines whether language customization is enabled within the B2C user flow. Language customization is not enabled by default for B2C user flows.|
|defaultLanguageTag|String|Indicates the default language of the b2cIdentityUserFlow that is used when no `ui_locale` tag is specified in the request. This field is [RFC 5646](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5646) compliant.|
|apiConnectorConfiguration|[userFlowApiConnectorConfiguration](../resources/userflowapiconnectorconfiguration.md)|Configuration for enabling an API connector for use as part of the user flow. You can only obtain the value of this object using [Get userFlowApiConnectorConfiguration](../api/b2cidentityuserflow-get-apiConnectorConfiguration.md).|
