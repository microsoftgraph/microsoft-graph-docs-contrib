# b2cIdentityUserFlow resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Represents a user flow within an Azure Active Directory B2C tenant.

To help you set up the most common identity tasks for your applications, Azure Active Directory B2C includes predefined, configurable policies called [user flows](/azure/active-directory-b2c/user-flow-overview). A user flow lets you determine how users interact with your application when they do things like sign in, sign up, edit a profile, or reset a password. You can create many user flows of different types in your tenant and use them in your applications as needed. With user flows, you can control the following capabilities:

- Account types used for sign-in, such as social accounts like a Facebook or local account
- Attributes to be collected from the consumer, such as first name, postal code, and shoe size
- Azure Multi-Factor Authentication
- Customization of the user interface
- Information that the application receives in the token
