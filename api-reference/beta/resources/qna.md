# qna resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph.search

Q&As are administrative answer results in the search results page which provide answers for specific search keywords. Q&As allow administrators to answer the user's questions directly in search instead of providing a link to a webpage. A Q&A has many properties which allow administrators to make common resources more accessible in their organization.\
