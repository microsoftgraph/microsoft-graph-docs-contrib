# plannerTeamsPublicationInfo resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Contains detailed information about the publication process that created a [plannerTask](plannertask.md). A publication process creates copies of tasks based on a template. These tasks are created in multiple plans, and have restricted permissions for the users; for example, they cannot be deleted and users might be blocked from editing certain fields. Publication is used to distribute tasks across an organization and track their progress centrally.
