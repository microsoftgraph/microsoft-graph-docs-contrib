# plannerSharedWithContainer resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Represents the relationship of a Planner plan to a Planner container. Plans can be shared with containers that aren't the original container the plan belongs to. When the plan is verifying a user's access to it, the plan will additionally check the authorization logic of the containers it's shared with.

Inherits from [plannerPlanContainer](plannerplancontainer.md).

| containerId | String | The identifier of the resource that contains the plan. Optional. Inherited from [plannerPlanContainer](plannerplancontainer.md). |
