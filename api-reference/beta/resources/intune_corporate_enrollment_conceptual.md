# Enroll corporate-owned devices by using Intune> **Important**: APIs under the /beta version in Microsoft Graph are in preview and are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported.> **Note:** Using the Microsoft Graph APIs to configure Intune controls and policies still requires that the Intune service is [correctly licensed](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/cloud-platform/microsoft-intune-pricing) by the customer.You can enroll organization-owned or corporate-owned devices to manage with Intune in a variety of ways, depending on the type of device, how the device was purchased, and the needs of the organization. You also can install the Company Portal app to enroll and manage corporate-owned devices, like in a "bring your own device" (BYOD) scenario.The following Graph resources are available to manage corporate-owned devices in Intune:- [DEP enrollment profile](intune_corpenrollment_depenrollmentprofile.md)- [Device management](intune_corpenrollment_devicemanagement.md)- [Enrollment profile](intune_corpenrollment_enrollmentprofile.md)- [Imported Apple device identity](intune_corpenrollment_importedappledeviceidentity.md)- [Imported Apple device identity result](intune_corpenrollment_importedappledeviceidentityresult.md)- [Imported device identity](intune_corpenrollment_importeddeviceidentity.md)- [Imported device identity result](intune_corpenrollment_importeddeviceidentityresult.md)- [Management certificate with thumbprint](intune_corpenrollment_managementcertificatewiththumbprint.md)
