# RemoteItem resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Indicates that a [**driveItem**](driveitem.md) references an item that exists in another drive.
This resource provides the unique IDs of the source drive and target item.

[**DriveItems**](driveitem.md) with a non-null **remoteItem** facet are resources that are shared, added to the user's OneDrive, or on items returned from heterogenous collections of items (like search results).

**Note:** Unlike with folders in the same drive, a **driveItem** moved into a remote item may have its `id` value changed.
