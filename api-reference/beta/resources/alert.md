# alert resource type  (deprecated)

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

> [!NOTE]
> The legacy alerts API is deprecated and will be removed by April 2026. We recommend that you migrate to the new [alerts and incidents](/graph/api/resources/security-alert) API.

This resource corresponds to the first generation of alerts in the Microsoft Graph security API, representing potential security issues within a customer's tenant that Microsoft or a partner security solution identifies. 

This type of alerts federates calling of supported Azure and Microsoft 365 Defender security providers listed in [Use the Microsoft Graph security API](security-api-overview.md#legacy-alerts). It aggregates common alert data among the different domains to allow applications to unify and streamline management of security issues across all integrated solutions. 

To learn more, see the sample queries in [Graph Explorer](https://developer.microsoft.com/graph/graph-explorer).
