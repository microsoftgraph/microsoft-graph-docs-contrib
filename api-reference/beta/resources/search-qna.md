# qna resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph.search

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Represents a question and answer (Q&A) in Microsoft Search. Q&As are administrative answer results in the search results page that provide answers for specific search keywords. Q&As allow administrators to answer the user's questions directly in search instead of providing a link to a webpage. A Q&A has many properties that allow administrators to make common resources more accessible in their organization.

Inherits from [searchAnswer](../resources/search-searchanswer.md).
