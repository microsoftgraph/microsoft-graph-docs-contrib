# Working with the authentication methods usage report API

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Authentication methods activity reports provides information on the registration and usage of [authentication methods](../resources/authenticationmethods-overview.md) in your tenant.

These reports provide information such as:

- How many users are registered for each authentication method
- How many users are registered for features such as multifactor authentication (MFA), Self-Service Password Reset (SSPR), and passwordless authentication.
- The failure rates of each authentication method

These reports are available on the Microsoft Entra portal through **Protection** tab group > **Authentication methods** tab > **Activity** tab under the *Monitoring* tab group.

## Licenses

A Microsoft Entra ID P1 or P2 license is required to access authentication methods usage and insights reports. Microsoft Entra multifactor authentication and self-service password reset (SSPR) licensing information can be found on the [Microsoft Entra pricing site](https://www.microsoft.com/security/business/microsoft-entra-pricing).
