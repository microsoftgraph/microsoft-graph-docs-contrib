Namespace: microsoft.graph.security

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

[!INCLUDE [threatintelligence-api-disclaimer](../../includes/threatintelligence-api-disclaimer.md)]

Represents an IP address, which is (or has been) addressable over the internet. This resource acts as a grouping mechanism for related details about the hostname or IP address, such as the reputation, any related trackers or cookies, and so on.
