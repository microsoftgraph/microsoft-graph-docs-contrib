# windows81VpnConfiguration resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph

> **Important:** Microsoft supports Intune /beta APIs, but they are subject to more frequent change. Microsoft recommends using version v1.0 when possible. Check an API's availability in version v1.0 using the Version selector.

> **Note:** The Microsoft Graph API for Intune requires an [active Intune license](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=839381) for the tenant.

By providing the configurations in this profile you can instruct the Windows 8.1 (and later) devices to connect to desired VPN endpoint. By specifying the authentication method and security types expected by VPN endpoint you can make the VPN connection seamless for end user.
