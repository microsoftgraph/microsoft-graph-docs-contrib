# accessReviewStage resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

[!INCLUDE [accessreviews-disclaimer-v2](../../includes/accessreviews-disclaimer-v2.md)]

Represents a stage of a Microsoft Entra [access review](accessreviewsv2-overview.md) recurrence. If the parent [accessReviewScheduleDefinition](accessreviewscheduledefinition.md) has defined the **stageSettings** property, the [accessReviewInstance](accessReviewInstance.md) is comprised of up to three subsequent stages. Each stage can have a different set of reviewers who can act on the stage decisions, and settings determining which decisions pass from stage to stage.

Every **accessReviewStage** contains a list of [decisions](accessreviewinstancedecisionitem.md) that reviewers can take action on. There is only one decision per identity being reviewed.

## Properties
|Property|Type|Description|
|:---|:---|:---|
