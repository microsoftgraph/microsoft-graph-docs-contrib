# membersAddedEventMessageDetail resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Represents the details of an event message about members added.
This message is generated when members are added to a chat, a channel, or a team.
The **visibleHistoryStartDateTime** property for a members added event in a channel is always set to `0001-01-01T00:00:00Z`, which indicates that all history is shared.

> **Note**: For a chat, when the selected share history time for members is earlier than the initator's visible history time, the
**visibleHistoryStartDateTime** property for [conversationMember](conversationmember.md) and the **membersAddedEventMessageDetail** message might have different values. [conversationMember](conversationmember.md) has the effective visible history time for the member based on initiator's visible history time.


Inherits from [eventMessageDetail](../resources/eventmessagedetail.md).
