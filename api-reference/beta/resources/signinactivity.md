# signInActivity resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Provides the last interactive or non-interactive sign-in *attempt* time for a specific [user](user.md). Because **signInActivity** describes a property of the user object, Microsoft Entra ID stores sign-in activity for your users for as long as the user object exists.

Effective December 1, 2023, the **lastSuccessfulSignInDateTime** property is available to provide the last *successful* sign-in time for a specific user, regardless of whether the sign-in was interactive or non-interactive. The data isn't backfilled for this property.

See an example of [getting the **signInActivity** details](../api/user-list.md#example-4-list-the-last-sign-in-time-of-users-with-a-specific-display-name).

## Properties

|lastNonInteractiveSignInDateTime|DateTimeOffset|The last non-interactive sign-in date for a specific user. You can use this field to calculate the last time a client attempted (either successfully or unsuccessfully) to sign in to the directory on behalf of a user. Because some users may use clients to access tenant resources rather than signing into your tenant directly, you can use the non-interactive sign-in date to along with lastSignInDateTime to identify inactive users. The timestamp type represents date and time information using ISO 8601 format and is always in UTC. For example, midnight UTC on Jan 1, 2014 is `2014-01-01T00:00:00Z`. Microsoft Entra ID maintains non-interactive sign-ins going back to May 2020.
