# businessFlowTemplate resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

In the Azure AD [access reviews](accessreviews-root.md) feature, the **businesFlowTemplate** represents an Azure AD business flow template. The identifier of a template, such as to review guest members of a group, is supplied by the caller when creating an access review.

The business flow template objects are automatically generated when the global administrator onboards the tenant to use the access reviews feature.  The business flow templates include access reviews of assignments to an application, memberships of a group, memberships of an Azure AD role, guest user memberships of a group, and guest user assignments to an application. No additional business flow templates can be created.
