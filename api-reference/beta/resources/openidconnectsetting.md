# openIdConnectSetting resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

A complex type that contains the settings required to perform the OIDC request to the external authentication provider for an [external authentication method](../resources/externalauthenticationmethodconfiguration.md). External authentication methods enable Microsoft Entra ID users to satisfy the second factor of multifactor authentication requirements using an external provider.

## Properties
|Property|Type|Description|
|:---|:---|:---|
|clientId|String|The Microsoft Entra ID's client ID as generated by the provider or admin to identify Microsoft Entra ID. In OIDC parlance, this is the client_id that external identity provider assigns to Microsoft Entra ID, which is also a recipient of a token from the external identity provider.|
|discoveryUrl|String|The host URL of the external identity provider's OIDC discovery endpoint. This endpoint must support the OIDC discovery process.|

## Relationships
