## Request body
In the request body, supply a JSON representation for the [aospDeviceOwnerWiFiConfiguration](../resources/intune-deviceconfig-aospdeviceownerwificonfiguration.md) object.

The following table shows the properties that are required when you create the [aospDeviceOwnerWiFiConfiguration](../resources/intune-deviceconfig-aospdeviceownerwificonfiguration.md).

|Property|Type|Description|
|:---|:---|:---|
|id|String|Key of the entity. Inherited from [deviceConfiguration](../resources/intune-shared-deviceconfiguration.md)|
|lastModifiedDateTime|DateTimeOffset|DateTime the object was last modified. Inherited from [deviceConfiguration](../resources/intune-shared-deviceconfiguration.md)|
|roleScopeTagIds|String collection|List of Scope Tags for this Entity instance. Inherited from [deviceConfiguration](../resources/intune-shared-deviceconfiguration.md)|
|supportsScopeTags|Boolean|Indicates whether or not the underlying Device Configuration supports the assignment of scope tags. Assigning to the ScopeTags property is not allowed when this value is false and entities will not be visible to scoped users. This occurs for Legacy policies created in Silverlight and can be resolved by deleting and recreating the policy in the Azure Portal. This property is read-only. Inherited from [deviceConfiguration](../resources/intune-shared-deviceconfiguration.md)|
|deviceManagementApplicabilityRuleOsEdition|[deviceManagementApplicabilityRuleOsEdition](../resources/intune-deviceconfig-devicemanagementapplicabilityruleosedition.md)|The OS edition applicability for this Policy. Inherited from [deviceConfiguration](../resources/intune-shared-deviceconfiguration.md)|
|deviceManagementApplicabilityRuleOsVersion|[deviceManagementApplicabilityRuleOsVersion](../resources/intune-deviceconfig-devicemanagementapplicabilityruleosversion.md)|The OS version applicability rule for this Policy. Inherited from [deviceConfiguration](../resources/intune-shared-deviceconfiguration.md)|
|deviceManagementApplicabilityRuleDeviceMode|[deviceManagementApplicabilityRuleDeviceMode](../resources/intune-deviceconfig-devicemanagementapplicabilityruledevicemode.md)|The device mode applicability rule for this Policy. Inherited from [deviceConfiguration](../resources/intune-shared-deviceconfiguration.md)|
|createdDateTime|DateTimeOffset|DateTime the object was created. Inherited from [deviceConfiguration](../resources/intune-shared-deviceconfiguration.md)|
|description|String|Admin provided description of the Device Configuration. Inherited from [deviceConfiguration](../resources/intune-shared-deviceconfiguration.md)|
|displayName|String|Admin provided name of the device configuration. Inherited from [deviceConfiguration](../resources/intune-shared-deviceconfiguration.md)|
|version|Int32|Version of the device configuration. Inherited from [deviceConfiguration](../resources/intune-shared-deviceconfiguration.md)|
|networkName|String|Network Name|
|ssid|String|This is the name of the Wi-Fi network that is broadcast to all devices.|
|connectAutomatically|Boolean|Connect automatically when this network is in range. Setting this to true will skip the user prompt and automatically connect the device to Wi-Fi network.|
|connectWhenNetworkNameIsHidden|Boolean|When set to true, this profile forces the device to connect to a network that doesn't broadcast its SSID to all devices.|
|wiFiSecurityType|[aospDeviceOwnerWiFiSecurityType](../resources/intune-deviceconfig-aospdeviceownerwifisecuritytype.md)|Indicates whether Wi-Fi endpoint uses an EAP based security type. Possible values are: `open`, `wep`, `wpaPersonal`, `wpaEnterprise`.|
|preSharedKey|String|This is the pre-shared key for WPA Personal Wi-Fi network.|
|preSharedKeyIsSet|Boolean|This is the pre-shared key for WPA Personal Wi-Fi network.|
|proxySetting|[wiFiProxySetting](../resources/intune-deviceconfig-wifiproxysetting.md)|Specify the proxy setting for Wi-Fi configuration. Possible values include none, manual, and automatic. Possible values are: `none`, `manual`, `automatic`, `unknownFutureValue`.|
|proxyManualAddress|String|Specify the proxy server IP address. Both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses are supported. For example: 192.168.1.1.|
|proxyManualPort|Int32|Specify the proxy server port.|
|proxyAutomaticConfigurationUrl|String|Specify the proxy server configuration script URL.|
