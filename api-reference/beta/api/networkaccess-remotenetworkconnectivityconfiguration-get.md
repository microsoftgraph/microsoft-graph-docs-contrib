# Get remoteNetworkConnectivityConfiguration
Namespace: microsoft.graph.networkaccess

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Retrieve the IPSec tunnel configuration required to establish a bidirectional communication link between your organization's router and the Microsoft gateway. This information is vital for configuring your router (customer premise equipment) after creating a [deviceLink](../resources/networkaccess-devicelink.md). Refer to [Configure customer premises equipment for Global Secure Access](/entra/global-secure-access/how-to-configure-customer-premises-equipment?tabs=microsoft-entra-admin-center) to understand how to use this information to set up your router.
