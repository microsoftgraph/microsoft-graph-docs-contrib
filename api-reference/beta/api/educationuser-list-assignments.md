# List assignments of a user

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Returns a list of assignments assigned to a user for all classes. Only teachers, students, and applications with application permissions can perform this operation.

This utility namespace allows a caller to find all of a student's or teacher's assignments in a single call, rather than having to request assignments from each class. The assignment list contains what is needed to get the detailed information for the assignment from within the class namespace. All other operations on the assignment should use the class namespace.

[!INCLUDE [national-cloud-support](../../includes/global-only.md)]

## Permissions

Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](/graph/permissions-reference).

<!-- { "blockType": "permissions", "name": "educationuser_list_assignments" } -->
[!INCLUDE [permissions-table](../includes/permissions/educationuser-list-assignments-permissions.md)]

Calling the `/me` endpoint requires a signed-in user and therefore delegated permissions. Application permissions aren't supported when using the `/me` endpoint.

The `/users/{user-id}` endpoint works with delegated and application permissions.

## HTTP request

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->

```http
GET /education/me/assignments
GET /education/users/{user-id}/assignments
```

## Optional query parameters

This method supports the `$top`, `$filter`, `$orderby`, and `$select` OData query parameters to help customize the response. For more information, see [OData query parameters](/graph/query-parameters).

The following `$expand` options are available for this method: `categories`, `resources`, `gradingCategory`, `rubric`, `submissions`, and `*`, which includes all the previous options.

All [properties](../resources/educationassignment.md#properties) are supported by the `$filter` query parameter.

You can use `$orderby` with the following properties of the [educationAssignment](../resources/educationassignment.md) resource: **assignDateTime**, **assignedDateTime**, **closeDateTime**, **createdDateTime**, **displayName**, **dueDateTime**, **lastModifiedDateTime**, and **status**.

## Request headers

| Header        | Value                     |
| :------------ | :------------------------ |
|Authorization|Bearer {token}. Required. Learn more about [authentication and authorization](/graph/auth/auth-concepts).|

## Request body

Don't supply a request body for this method.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and a collection of [educationAssignment](../resources/educationassignment.md) objects in the response body.
