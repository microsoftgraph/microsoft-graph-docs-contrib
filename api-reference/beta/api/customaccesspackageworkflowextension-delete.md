# Delete customAccessPackageWorkflowExtension
Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Delete a [customAccessPackageWorkflowExtension](../resources/customaccesspackageworkflowextension.md) object. The custom workflow extension must first be removed from any associated [policies](../resources/accesspackageassignmentpolicy.md) before it can be deleted. Follow these steps to remove the custom workflow extension from any associated policies:
1. First retrieve the accessPackageCatalogId by calling the [Get accessPackageAssignmentPolicies](accesspackageassignmentpolicy-get.md) operation and appending `?$expand=accessPackage($expand=accessPackageCatalog)` to the query. For example, `https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/identityGovernance/entitlementManagement/accessPackageAssignmentPolicies?$expand=accessPackage($expand=accessPackageCatalog)`.
2. Use the access package catalog ID and retrieve the ID of the **customAccessPackageWorkflowExtension** object that you want to delete by running the [LIST customAccessPackageWorkflowExtensions](accesspackagecatalog-list-customaccesspackageworkflowextensions.md) operation.
3. Call the [Update accessPackageAssignmentPolicy](accesspackageassignmentpolicy-update.md) operation to remove the custom workflow extension object from the policy. For an example, see [Example 2: Remove the customExtensionHandlers and verifiableCredentialSettings from a policy](accesspackageassignmentpolicy-update.md#example-2-remove-the-customextensionhandlers-and-verifiablecredentialsettings-from-a-policy).
