## HTTP request
<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
GET /servicePrincipals/{id}/transitiveMemberOf
```
## Optional query parameters
This method supports the [OData Query Parameters](https://developer.microsoft.com/graph/docs/concepts/query_parameters) to help customize the response including `$search`, `$count`, and `$filter`. OData cast is also enabled, for example, you can cast to get just the directoryRoles the user is a member of. You can use `$search` on the **displayName** property. When items are added or updated for this resource, they are specially indexed for use with the `$count` and `$search` query parameters. There can be a slight delay between when an item is added or updated and when it is available in the index.

## Request headers
| Name       | Type | Description|
|:-----------|:------|:----------|
| Authorization  | string  | Bearer {token}. Required. |
| ConsistencyLevel | The value is always `eventual`. This header is required when using the `$count`, `$search`, `$filter`, and OData cast query parameters. It uses an index that may not be up-to-date with recent changes to the object. |

## Request body
Do not supply a request body for this method.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and collection of [directoryObject](../resources/directoryobject.md) objects in the response body.
