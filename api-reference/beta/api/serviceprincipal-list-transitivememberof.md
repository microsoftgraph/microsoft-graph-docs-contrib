- OData cast is also enabled.
- `$search` is supported on the **displayName** and **description** properties only.
- The default and maximum page size is 100 and 999 objects respectively.
- The use of query parameters with this API is supported only with advanced query parameters. For more information, see [Advanced query capabilities on directory objects](/graph/aad-advanced-queries).

## Request headers

| Name       | Type | Description|
