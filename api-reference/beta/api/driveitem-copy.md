### Response
<!-- { "blockType": "response" } -->
```http
HTTP/1.1 202 Accepted
Location: https://contoso.sharepoint.com/_api/v2.0/monitor/4A3407B5-88FC-4504-8B21-0AABD3412717
```
The value of the `Location` header provides a URL for a service that will return the current state of the copy operation.
You can use this information to [determine when the copy has finished](/graph/long-running-actions-overview).

### Remarks

In many cases the copy action is performed asynchronously.
The response from the API will only indicate that the copy operation was accepted or rejected; for example, due to the destination filename already being in use.

[item-resource]: ../resources/driveitem.md
