Create a new [unifiedRoleAssignment](../resources/unifiedroleassignment.md) object.

## Permissions

Depending on the RBAC provider and the permission type (delegated or application) that is needed, choose from the following table the least privileged permission required to call this API. To learn more, including [taking caution](/graph/auth/auth-concepts#best-practices-for-requesting-permissions) before choosing more privileged permissions, search for the following permissions in [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

### For Directory (Azure AD) provider

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) |  RoleManagement.ReadWrite.Directory   |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported.    |
|Application | RoleManagement.ReadWrite.Directory |

### For Entitlement management provider

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) |  EntitlementManagement.ReadWrite.All   |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported.    |
|Application | Not supported. |

## HTTP request

Create a role assignment for the directory provider:

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->

```http
POST /roleManagement/directory/roleAssignments
```

Create a role assignment for the entitlement management provider:

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->

```http
POST /roleManagement/entitlementManagement/roleAssignments
```


## Request headers

| Name          | Description   |
|:--------------|:--------------|
| Authorization | Bearer {token} |

## Request body

In the request body, supply a JSON representation of a [unifiedRoleAssignment](../resources/unifiedroleassignment.md) object. The request must have either a scope defined in Azure AD, such as **directoryScopeId**, or an application-specific scope, such as **appScopeId**. Examples of Azure AD scopes are tenant ("/"), administrative units, or applications. Entitlement management uses tenant ("/") and access package catalog scopes. For more information, see [appScope](../resources/appscope.md).

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `201 Created` response code and a new [unifiedRoleAssignment](../resources/unifiedroleassignment.md) object in the response body.

## Examples

### Example 1: Create a role assignment at tenant scope

#### Request

The following is an example of the request. Note the use of the roleTemplateId for roleDefinitionId. roleDefinitionId can be either the service-wide template Id or the directory-specific roleDefinitionId.
