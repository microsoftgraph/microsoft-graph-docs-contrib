# mailboxFolder: delta

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Get a set of [mailboxFolder](../resources/mailboxfolder.md) objects that have been added, deleted, or removed from the user's mailbox.

A **delta** function call for folders in a mailbox is similar to a GET request, except that by appropriately applying [state tokens](/graph/delta-query-overview) in one or more of these calls, you can query for incremental changes in the folders. This approach allows you to maintain and synchronize a local store of a user's mail folders without having to fetch all the folders of that mailbox from the server every time.

## Permissions

Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](/graph/permissions-reference).

## HTTP request

<!-- {
  "blockType": "ignored"
}
-->
``` http
GET /admin/exchange/mailboxes/{mailboxId}/folders/delta
GET /admin/exchange/mailboxes/{mailboxId}/folders/{mailboxFolderId}/childFolders/delta
```

## Query parameters

Tracking changes in folders incurs a round of one or more **delta** function calls. If you use any query parameter (other than `$deltaToken` and `$skipToken`), you must specify it in the initial **delta** request. Microsoft Graph automatically encodes any specified parameters into the token portion of the `nextLink` or `deltaLink` URL provided in the response. You only need to specify any desired query parameters once upfront. In subsequent requests, simply copy and apply the `nextLink` or `deltaLink` URL from the previous response, as that URL already includes the encoded, desired parameters.

| Query parameter|Description|
|:----------------|:--------|
| $deltaToken|A [state token](/graph/delta-query-overview) returned in the `deltaLink` URL of the previous **delta** function call for the same folder collection, which indicates the completion of that round of change tracking. Save and apply the entire `deltaLink` URL including this token in the first request of the next round of change tracking for that collection.|
| $skipToken|A [state token](/graph/delta-query-overview) returned in the `nextLink` URL of the previous **delta** function call, indicating further changes are available to be tracked in the same folder collection.|

### OData query parameters

You can use the `$select` query parameter to specify only the properties you need for best performance. The **id** and **parentMailboxUrl** properties are always returned.

## Request headers

|Name|Description|
|:---|:---|
|Authorization|Bearer {token}. Required. Learn more about [authentication and authorization](/graph/auth/auth-concepts).|
|Prefer|odata.maxpagesize={x}. Optional.|

## Request body

Don't supply a request body for this method.

## Response

If successful, this function returns a `200 OK` response code and a collection of [mailboxFolder](../resources/mailboxfolder.md) objects in the response body.

## Examples

### Request

The following example shows how to make a single **delta** function call, and limit the maximum number of folders in the response body to two.

To track changes in the folders of a mailbox, you make one or more **delta** function calls, with appropriate state tokens, to get the set of incremental changes since the last delta query.

For a similar example that shows how to use the state tokens to track changes in the items of a folder, see [Get incremental changes to messages in a folder](/graph/delta-query-messages). The main differences between tracking folders and tracking items in a folder are in the delta query request URLs and the query responses that return **folder** rather than **item** collections.

### Response

If the request is successful, the response includes a state token that is either a `$skipToken` (in an **@odata.nextLink** response header) or a `$deltaToken` (in an **@odata.deltaLink** response header). Respectively, they indicate whether you should continue with the round or you completed getting all the changes for that round.

The following example shows a `$deltaToken` in an **@odata.deltaLink** response header.
