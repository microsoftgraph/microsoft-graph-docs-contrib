# Create temporaryAccessPassAuthenticationMethod
Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Create a new [temporaryAccessPassAuthenticationMethod](../resources/temporaryaccesspassauthenticationmethod.md) object on a user. A user can only have one Temporary Access Pass. The passcode can be used between the start and end time of the Temporary Access Pass. If the user requires a new Temporary Access Pass:
* While the current Temporary Access Pass is valid – the admin needs to delete the existing Temporary Access Pass and create a new pass on the user. Deleting a valid Temporary Access Pass will revoke the user’s sessions. 
* After the Temporary Access Pass has expired – a new temporary access pass overrides the current temporary access pass and doesn't revoke the user’s sessions.


## Permissions

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

### Permissions acting on self

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:---------------------------------------|:-------------------------|
| Delegated (work or school account)     | UserAuthenticationMethod.ReadWrite |
| Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported. |
| Application                            | Not supported. |

### Permissions acting on other users

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:---------------------------------------|:-------------------------|
| Delegated (work or school account)     | UserAuthenticationMethod.ReadWrite.All |
| Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported. |
| Application                            | UserAuthenticationMethod.ReadWrite.All |

For delegated scenarios where an admin is acting on another user, the admin needs [one of the following roles](/azure/active-directory/users-groups-roles/directory-assign-admin-roles#available-roles):
* Global admin
* Privileged authentication admin
* Authentication admin

```

## Request headers
|Name|Description|
|:---|:---|
|Authorization|Bearer {token}. Required.|

## Request body
In the request body, supply a JSON representation of the [temporaryAccessPassAuthenticationMethod](../resources/temporaryaccesspassauthenticationmethod.md) object.

|Property|Type|Description|Required| 
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
|startDateTime|DateTimeOffset|The date and time when the temporaryAccessPass becomes available to use, if not set the Temporary Access Pass is available to use at creation time.| No|
|lifetimeInMinutes|Int32|The lifetime of the temporaryAccessPass in minutes starting at creation time or at startDateTime, if set. Minimum 10, Maximum 43200 (equivalent to 30 days).| No|
|isUsableOnce|Boolean|Determines if the pass is limited to a one time use. If True – the pass can be used once, if False – the pass can be used multiple times within the temporaryAccessPass life time. A multi-use Temporary Access Pass (isUsableOnce = false), can only be created and used for sign-in if it is allowed by the Temporary Access Pass Authentication method policy.|  No|
