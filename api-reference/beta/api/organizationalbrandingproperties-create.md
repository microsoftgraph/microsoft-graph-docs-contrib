# Create organizationalBrandingProperties

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Create an [organizationalBrandingProperties](../resources/organizationalbrandingproperties.md) object. This creates the default branding and optionally a localized branding at the same time. The default branding is loaded when a localized branding set isn't configured for the user's browser language.

## Permissions

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

| Permission type                        | Permissions (from least to most privileged) |
|:---------------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------|
| Delegated (work or school account)     | Organization.ReadWrite.All |
| Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported. |
| Application                            | Not supported. |

## HTTP request

A branding is created for an organization, if one does not already exist, using PUT or PATCH.

If branding is already configured, PUT will overwrite all existing values regardless of what's in the request body. PATCH will only overite the values that are included in the request body, leaving the values not included unchanged.

The **id** property is ignored on PUT/PATCH to the /branding singleton. If Content-Language is not specified, the default branding is created, which corresponds to an **id** of `und`. If Content-Language is specified, branding is created for that locale.
<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->

```http
PUT /organization/{tenant id}/branding
PATCH /organization/{tenant id}/branding
```

### Response

The following is an example of the response.

<!-- {
  "blockType": "response",
  "truncated": true,
  "@odata.type": "microsoft.graph.organizationalBrandingProperties"
} -->

```http
HTTP/1.1 201 Created

    "backgroundColor":"#FFFF33",
    "backgroundImage@odata.mediaContentType":"image/*",
    "backgroundImage@odata.mediaReadLink": "https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/organization/d69179bf-f4a4-41a9-a9de-249c0f2efb1d/branding/backgroundImage",
    "backgroundImage@odata.mediaEditLink": "https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/organization/d69179bf-f4a4-41a9-a9de-249c0f2efb1d/branding/localizations/backgroundImage",
    "bannerLogo@odata.mediaContentType":"image/*",
    "bannerLogo@odata.mediaReadLink": "https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/organization/d69179bf-f4a4-41a9-a9de-249c0f2efb1d/branding/bannerLogo",
    "bannerLogo@odata.mediaEditLink": "https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/organization/d69179bf-f4a4-41a9-a9de-249c0f2efb1d/branding/localizations/bannerLogo",
    "id": "und",
    "signInPageText":"Welcome",
    "squareLogo@odata.mediaContentType":"image/*",
    "squareLogo@odata.mediaReadLink": "https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/organization/d69179bf-f4a4-41a9-a9de-249c0f2efb1d/branding/squareLogo",
    "squareLogo@odata.mediaEditLink": "https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/organization/d69179bf-f4a4-41a9-a9de-249c0f2efb1d/branding/localizations/squareLogo",
    "usernameHintText":"hint"
}
```

In this case, the default branding object is set. Localized branding for en-US is also set due to the Content-Language in the header, even though the en-US branding set is not returned in the response. Note that Content-Language in the request is optional, and if not present, will only set default branding.
