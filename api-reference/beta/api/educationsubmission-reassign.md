# educationSubmission: reassign

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Reassign the [submission](../resources/educationsubmission.md) to the student with feedback for review.

Only teachers can perform this action. 

Include the `Prefer: include-unknown-enum-members` header when you call this method; otherwise, a reassigned submission will be treated as a returned submission. This means that the `reassigned` status will be mapped to the `returned` status, and **reassignedDateTime** and **reassignedBy** properties will be mapped to **returnedDateTime** and **returnedBy** respectively.

If the header `Prefer: include-unknown-enum-members` is provided, a reassigned submission retains the `reassigned` status. For details, see the examples section.

[!INCLUDE [national-cloud-support](../../includes/global-only.md)]
