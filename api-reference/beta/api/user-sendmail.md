# user: sendMail

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Send the message specified in the request body using either JSON or MIME format.

When using JSON format you can include an [attachment](../resources/attachment.md) and use a [mention](../resources/mention.md) to call out another user in the new message.

When using MIME format:
- Provide the applicable [Internet message headers](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2076) and the [MIME content](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2045), all encoded in **base64** format in the request body.
- Add any attachments and S/MIME properties to the MIME content.

This method saves the message in the **Sent Items** folder.

Alternatively, [create a draft message](../api/user-post-messages.md) to send later.

To learn more about the steps involved in the backend before a mail is delivered to recipients, see [here](/graph/outlook-things-to-know-about-send-mail).

- Include the required **toRecipients** property, the **mentions** property, and any writable message properties in the request body.
- For each mention in the **mentions** property, you must specify the **mentioned** property.

## Response
