# Get user mailbox settings

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Get the user's [mailboxSettings](../resources/mailboxsettings.md). You can view all mailbox settings, or get specific settings.

Users can set the following settings for their mailboxes through an Outlook client:

- [automatic replies](../resources/automaticrepliessetting.md) (notify people automatically upon
receipt of their email)
- date format
- delegateMeetingMessageDeliveryOptions
- [locale](../resources/localeinfo.md) (language and country/region)
- time format
- time zone
- [working hours](../resources/workinghours.md)
- [user purpose](../resources/mailboxsettings.md#userpurpose-values)

Users can set their preferred date and time formats using Outlook on the web. Users can choose one of the supported [short date](/dotnet/standard/base-types/standard-date-and-time-format-strings#ShortDate) or [short time](/dotnet/standard/base-types/standard-date-and-time-format-strings#ShortTime) formats. This `GET` operation returns the format the user has chosen.

Users can set the time zone they prefer on any Outlook client, by choosing from the [supported time zones](outlookuser-supportedtimezones.md) that their administrator has set up for their mailbox server. The administrator can set up time zones in the Windows time zone format or  [Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) time zone](https://www.iana.org/time-zones) (also known as Olson time zone) format. The Windows format is the default.

This `GET` operation returns the user's preferred time zone in the format that the administrator has set up. If you want that time zone to be in a specific format (Windows or IANA), you can first [update the preferred time zone in that format as a mailbox setting](user-update-mailboxsettings.md). Subsequently you will be able to get the time zone in that format. Alternatively, you can manage the format conversion separately in your app.
