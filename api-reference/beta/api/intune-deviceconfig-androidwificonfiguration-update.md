# Update androidWiFiConfiguration

> **Important:** APIs under the /beta version in Microsoft Graph are in preview and are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported.

> **Note:** Using the Microsoft Graph APIs to configure Intune controls and policies still requires that the Intune service is [correctly licensed](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=839381) by the customer.

Update the properties of a [androidWiFiConfiguration](../resources/intune-deviceconfig-androidwificonfiguration.md) object.

## HTTP Request
<!-- {
  "blockType": "ignored"
}
-->
``` http
PATCH /deviceManagement/deviceConfigurations/{deviceConfigurationId}
PATCH /deviceManagement/deviceConfigurations/{deviceConfigurationId}/groupAssignments/{deviceConfigurationGroupAssignmentId}/deviceConfiguration
PATCH /deviceManagement/deviceConfigurations/{deviceConfigurationId}/microsoft.graph.windowsDomainJoinConfiguration/networkAccessConfigurations/{deviceConfigurationId}
```

## Request headers
|Header|Value|
|:---|:---|
|Authorization|Bearer &lt;token&gt; Required.|
|Accept|application/json|

## Request body
In the request body, supply a JSON representation for the [androidWiFiConfiguration](../resources/intune-deviceconfig-androidwificonfiguration.md) object.

The following table shows the properties that are required when you create the [androidWiFiConfiguration](../resources/intune-deviceconfig-androidwificonfiguration.md).

|Property|Type|Description|
|:---|:---|:---|
|id|String|Key of the entity. Inherited from [deviceConfiguration](../resources/intune-deviceconfig-deviceconfiguration.md)|
|lastModifiedDateTime|DateTimeOffset|DateTime the object was last modified. Inherited from [deviceConfiguration](../resources/intune-deviceconfig-deviceconfiguration.md)|
|roleScopeTagIds|String collection|List of Scope Tags for this Entity instance. Inherited from [deviceConfiguration](../resources/intune-deviceconfig-deviceconfiguration.md)|
|supportsScopeTags|Boolean|Indicates whether or not the underlying Device Configuration supports the assignment of scope tags. Assigning to the ScopeTags property is not allowed when this value is false and entities will not be visible to scoped users. This occurs for Legacy policies created in Silverlight and can be resolved by deleting and recreating the policy in the Azure Portal. This property is read-only. Inherited from [deviceConfiguration](../resources/intune-deviceconfig-deviceconfiguration.md)|
|createdDateTime|DateTimeOffset|DateTime the object was created. Inherited from [deviceConfiguration](../resources/intune-deviceconfig-deviceconfiguration.md)|
|description|String|Admin provided description of the Device Configuration. Inherited from [deviceConfiguration](../resources/intune-deviceconfig-deviceconfiguration.md)|
|displayName|String|Admin provided name of the device configuration. Inherited from [deviceConfiguration](../resources/intune-deviceconfig-deviceconfiguration.md)|
|version|Int32|Version of the device configuration. Inherited from [deviceConfiguration](../resources/intune-deviceconfig-deviceconfiguration.md)|
|networkName|String|Network Name|
|ssid|String|This is the name of the Wi-Fi network that is broadcast to all devices.|
|connectAutomatically|Boolean|Connect automatically when this network is in range. Setting this to true will skip the user prompt and automatically connect the device to Wi-Fi network.|
|connectWhenNetworkNameIsHidden|Boolean|When set to true, this profile forces the device to connect to a network that doesn't broadcast its SSID to all devices.|
|wiFiSecurityType|[androidWiFiSecurityType](../resources/intune-deviceconfig-androidwifisecuritytype.md)|Indicates whether Wi-Fi endpoint uses an EAP based security type. Possible values are: `open`, `wpaEnterprise`.|

If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and an updated [androidWiFiConfiguration](../resources/intune-deviceconfig-androidwificonfiguration.md) object in the response body.
