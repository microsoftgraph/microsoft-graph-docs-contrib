# Get cloudClipboardItem
Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Read the properties and relationships of a [cloudClipboardItem](../resources/cloudclipboarditem.md) object. This API only allows you to get a [cloudClipboardItem](../resources/cloudclipboarditem.md) object for:
- The signed-in user's own [cloudClipboardItem](../resources/cloudclipboarditem.md).
- An app on behalf of the user if the user grants delegated access to it.

This API doesn't support using another user's credentials to get a [cloudClipboardItem](../resources/cloudclipboarditem.md) for a user.

[!INCLUDE [national-cloud-support](../../includes/global-only.md)]

## Permissions

Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](/graph/permissions-reference).
