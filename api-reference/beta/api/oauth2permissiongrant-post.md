# Create a delegated permission grant (oAuth2PermissionGrant)

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Create a delegated permission grant. A delegated permission grant is represented by an [oAuth2PermissionGrant](../resources/oauth2permissiongrant.md) object.

A delegated permission grant authorizes a client service principal (representing a client application) to access a resource service principal (representing an API), on behalf of a signed-in user, for the level of access limited by the delegated permissions which were granted.

## Permissions

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) | DelegatedPermissionGrant.ReadWrite.All, Directory.ReadWrite.All, Directory.AccessAsUser.All    |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported.    |
|Application | Directory.ReadWrite.All |
