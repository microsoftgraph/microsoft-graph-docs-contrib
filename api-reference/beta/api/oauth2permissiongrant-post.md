# Create oAuth2PermissionGrant (a delegated permission grant)

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Create a delegated permission grant, represented by an [oAuth2PermissionGrant](../resources/oauth2permissiongrant.md) object.

A delegated permission grant authorizes a client service principal (representing a client application) to access a resource service principal (representing an API), on behalf of a signed-in user, for the level of access limited by the delegated permissions which were granted.

[!INCLUDE [national-cloud-support](../../includes/all-clouds.md)]

## Permissions

Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](/graph/permissions-reference).

## HTTP request

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->

```http
POST /oauth2PermissionGrants
```

## Request headers

| Name       | Type | Description |
|:-----------|:------|:----------|
| Authorization  | string  |Bearer {token}. Required. Learn more about [authentication and authorization](/graph/auth/auth-concepts).|

## Request body

In the request body, supply a JSON representation of an [oAuth2PermissionGrant](../resources/oauth2permissiongrant.md) object.

The following table lists the properties that are required when you create the [oAuth2PermissionGrant](../resources/oauth2permissiongrant.md).

| Property | Type | Description |
|:---------------|:--------|:----------|
| clientId | String | The object **id** (*not* **appId**) of the client [service principal](../resources/serviceprincipal.md) for the application which is authorized to act on behalf of a signed-in user when accessing an API. Required.  |
| consentType | String | Indicates whether authorization is granted for the client application to impersonate all users or only a specific user. *AllPrincipals* indicates authorization to impersonate all users. *Principal* indicates authorization to impersonate a specific user. Consent on behalf of all users can be granted by an administrator. Non-admin users may be authorized to consent on behalf of themselves in some cases, for some delegated permissions. Required.  |
| principalId | String | The **id** of the [user](../resources/user.md) on behalf of whom the client is authorized to access the resource, when **consentType** is *Principal*. If **consentType** is *AllPrincipals* this value is null. Required when **consentType** is *Principal*. |
| resourceId | String | The **id** of the resource [service principal](../resources/serviceprincipal.md) to which access is authorized. This identifies the API which the client is authorized to attempt to call on behalf of a signed-in user. |
| scope | String | A space-separated list of the claim values for delegated permissions which should be included in access tokens for the resource application (the API). For example, `openid User.Read GroupMember.Read.All`. Each claim value should match the **value** field of one of the delegated permissions defined by the API, listed in the **publishedPermissionScopes** property of the resource [service principal](../resources/serviceprincipal.md).  Must not exceed 3850 characters in length.|
| startTime | DateTimeOffset | Currently, the start time value is ignored, but a value is required. Required. |
| expiryTime | DateTimeOffset | Currently, the end time value is ignored, but a value is required. Required. |

## Response

If successful, this method returns a 200-series response code and a new [oAuth2PermissionGrant](../resources/oauth2permissiongrant.md) object in the response body.
