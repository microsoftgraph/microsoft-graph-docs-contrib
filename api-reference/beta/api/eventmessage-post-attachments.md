# Add attachment

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Use this API to create a new Attachment.

An attachment can be one of the following types:

* A file ([fileAttachment](../resources/fileattachment.md) resource).
* An item (contact, event or message, represented by an [itemAttachment](../resources/itemattachment.md) resource).
* A link to a file ([referenceAttachment](../resources/referenceattachment.md) resource).

All these types of attachment resources are derived from the [attachment](../resources/attachment.md)
resource.

[!INCLUDE [national-cloud-support](../../includes/all-clouds.md)]
