## Permissions

Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](/graph/permissions-reference).

## HTTP request

<!-- {
  "blockType": "ignored"
}
-->
``` http
DELETE /users/{id}/sponsors/{id}/$ref
```

> [!CAUTION]
> If `/$ref` is not appended to the request and the calling app has permissions to manage the sponsor object type, the sponsor object is also deleted from Microsoft Entra ID; otherwise, a `403 Forbidden` error is returned. For example, an app with `User.ReadWrite.All` permissions deletes a user who is a sponsor. You can restore specific objects through the [Restore deleted items API](directory-deleteditems-restore.md).
