# Get longRunningOperation
Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Read the properties and relationships of a [longRunningOperation](../resources/longrunningoperation.md) object. This API allows you to retrieve the details and status of the following long-running Microsoft Graph API operations.

- [Role management alert refresh](unifiedrolemanagementalert-refresh.md)
- [Password reset](authenticationmethod-resetpassword.md)

The possible states of the long-running operation are `notStarted`, `running`, `succeeded`, `failed`, `unknownFutureValue` where `succeeded` and `failed` are terminal states.

[!INCLUDE [national-cloud-support](../../includes/all-clouds.md)]

## Permissions
Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](/graph/permissions-reference).
