|Permission type      | Least privileged permission | Higher privileged permissions |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------|:-----------------------------|

## HTTP request

<!-- {
  "blockType": "ignored"
}
-->
``` http
GET /users/{usersId}/manager
```

## Optional query parameters

This method supports the `$select` and `$expand` [OData query parameters](/graph/query-parameters) to help customize the response. When using the `$expand` query parameter:

+ The `n` value of `$levels` can be `max` (to return all managers) or a number between 1 and 1000.
+ When the `$levels` parameter is not specified, only the immediate manager is returned.
+ You can specify `$select` inside `$expand` to select the individual manager's properties: `$expand=manager($levels=max;$select=id,displayName)`.
+ `$levels` parameter is only supported on a single user (`/users/{id}` or `me` endpoints) and not on the entire list of users.
+ Use of `$levels` requires the **ConsistencyLevel** header set to `eventual`. For more information about the use of **ConsistencyLevel**, see [Advanced query capabilities on directory objects](/graph/aad-advanced-queries).
