# List sharing permissions on a driveItem

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

List the effective sharing permissions on a [driveItem](../resources/driveitem.md).

[!INCLUDE [national-cloud-support](../../includes/all-clouds.md)]

## Access to sharing permissions

The permissions collection includes potentially sensitive information and may not be available for every caller.

* For the owner of the item, all sharing permissions are returned. It includes co-owners.
* For a non-owner caller, only the sharing permissions that apply to the caller are returned.
* Sharing permission properties that contain secrets (for example, `shareId` and `webUrl`) are only returned for callers that are able to create the sharing permission.

## Permissions

Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](/graph/permissions-reference).

[!INCLUDE [app-permissions](../includes/sharepoint-embedded-app-driveitem-permissions.md)]

## HTTP request

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->

```http
GET /drives/{drive-id}/items/{item-id}/permissions
GET /groups/{group-id}/drive/items/{item-id}/permissions
GET /me/drive/items/{item-id}/permissions
GET /me/drive/root:/{path}:/permissions
GET /sites/{siteId}/drive/items/{itemId}/permissions
GET /users/{userId}/drive/items/{itemId}/permissions
```

## Optional query parameters

This method supports the `$select` [OData Query Parameters](/graph/query-parameters) to customize the response.

## Optional request headers

| Name          | Type   | Description                                                                                                                                     |
|:--------------|:-------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| if-none-match | string | If this request header is included and the etag provided matches the current etag on the item, an `HTTP 304 Not Modified` response is returned. |

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and collection of [Permission](../resources/permission.md) resources in the response body.

Effective sharing permissions of a driveItem can come from two sources:

* Sharing permissions applied directly on the driveItem itself
* Sharing permissions inherited from the driveItem's ancestors

Callers can differentiate if the permission is inherited or not by checking the **inheritedFrom** property.
This property is an [**itemReference**](../resources/itemreference.md) resource referencing the ancestor that the permission is inherited from.

## Example

This example retrieves the collection of permissions on an item in the signed in user's drive.

### Response

This example response includes three permissions, the first is a sharing link with edit permissions, the second is an explicit permission for a user named John, which was inherited from a parent folder, and the third is a read-write sharing link created by an application.

## Remarks

The **permissions** relationship of driveItem can't be expanded as part of a call to [get driveItem](driveitem-get.md) or a collection of driveItems.
You must access the permissions property directly.
