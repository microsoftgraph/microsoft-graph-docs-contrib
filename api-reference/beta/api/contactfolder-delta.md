# contactFolder: delta

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Get a set of contact folders that have been added, deleted, or removed from the user's mailbox.

A **delta** function call for contact folders in a mailbox is similar to a GET request, except that by appropriately 
applying [state tokens](/graph/delta-query-overview) in one or more of these calls, 
you can query for incremental changes in the contact folders. This allows you to maintain and synchronize 
a local store of a user's contact folders without having to fetch all the contact folders of that mailbox from the server every time.

## Permissions
One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).


|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) | Contacts.Read, Contacts.ReadWrite    |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Contacts.Read, Contacts.ReadWrite    |
|Application | Contacts.Read, Contacts.ReadWrite |

## HTTP request
<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
GET /me/contactFolders/delta
GET /users/{id}/contactFolders/delta
```

## Query parameters

Tracking changes in contact folders incurs a round of one or more **delta** function calls. If you use any query parameter 
(other than `$deltatoken` and `$skiptoken`), you must specify 
it in the initial **delta** request. Microsoft Graph automatically encodes any specified parameters 
into the token portion (`skiptoken` or `$deltatoken`) of the `nextLink` or `deltaLink` URL provided in the response. 
You only need to specify any desired query parameters once upfront. 
In subsequent requests, simply copy and apply the `nextLink` or `deltaLink` URL from the previous response, as that URL already 
includes the encoded, desired parameters.

| Query parameter	   | Type	|Description|
|:---------------|:--------|:----------|
| $deltatoken | string | A [state token](/graph/delta-query-overview) returned in the `deltaLink` URL of the previous **delta** function call for the same contact folder collection, indicating the completion of that round of change tracking. Save and apply the entire `deltaLink` URL including this token in the first request of the next round of change tracking for that collection.|
| $skiptoken | string | A [state token](/graph/delta-query-overview) returned in the `nextLink` URL of the previous **delta** function call, indicating there are further changes to be tracked in the same contact folder collection. |

### OData query parameters

You can use a `$select` query parameter as in any GET request to specify only the properties your need for best performance. The 
_id_ property is always returned. 

## Request headers
| Name       | Type | Description |
|:---------------|:----------|:----------|
| Authorization  | string  | Bearer {token}. Required. |
| Content-Type  | string  | application/json. Required. |
| Prefer | string  | odata.maxpagesize={x}. Optional. |

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and [contactFolder](../resources/contactfolder.md) collection object in the response body.

## Example
##### Request
The following example shows how to make a single **delta** function call, and limit the maximum number of contact folders 
in the response body to 2.

To track changes in the contact folders of a mailbox, you would make one or more **delta** function calls, with 
appropriate state tokens, to get the set of incremental changes since the last delta query. 

You can find a similar example that shows how to use the state tokens to track changes in the messages of a mail folder: 
[Get incremental changes to messages in a folder](/graph/delta-query-messages). The main differences
between tracking contact folders and tracking messages in a folder are in the delta query request URLs, and the query responses 
returning **contactFolder** rather than **message** collections.

##### Response

If the request is successful, the response would include a state token, which is either a _skipToken_  
(in an _@odata.nextLink_ response header) or a _deltaToken_ (in an _@odata.deltaLink_ response header). 
Respectively, they indicate whether you should continue with the round or you have completed 
getting all the changes for that round.

The response below shows a _skipToken_ in an _@odata.nextLink_ response header.

Note: The response object shown here might be shortened for readability.
