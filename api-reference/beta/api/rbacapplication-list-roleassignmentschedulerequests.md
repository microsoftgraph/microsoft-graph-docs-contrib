# List roleAssignmentScheduleRequests

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Retrieve the requests for active role assignments to principals. The active assignments include those made through [assignments and activation requests](rbacapplication-post-roleassignmentschedulerequests.md), and directly through the [role assignments API](../resources/unifiedroleassignment.md). The role assignments can be permanently active with or without an expiry date, or temporarily active after user activation of eligible assignments.
