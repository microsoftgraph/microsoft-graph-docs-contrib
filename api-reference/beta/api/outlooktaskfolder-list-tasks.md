# List tasks (deprecated)

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

[!INCLUDE [outlooktask-deprecate-allup](../../includes/outlooktask-deprecate-allup.md)]


Get all the Outlook tasks in the specified folder.

By default, this operation (and the POST, PATCH, and [complete](../api/outlooktask-complete.md) task operations) returns
date-related properties in UTC.  You can use a `Prefer: outlook.timezone` request header to have all the date-related properties in the response represented in a time zone
different than UTC. See an [example](outlooktask-get.md#example-2-get-outlook-task-with-date-time-properties-in-pacific-standard-time) for getting a single task. You can apply the header similarly to get multiple tasks.

If there is more than one task group, and you want to get all the tasks in a specific task group, first
[get all the task folders in that task group](outlooktaskgroup-list-taskfolders.md),
and then get the tasks in each of these task folders.
