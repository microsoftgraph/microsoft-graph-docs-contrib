# call: updateRecordingStatus

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Update the application's recording status associated with a call. This requires the use of the [Teams policy-based recording](/MicrosoftTeams/teams-recording-policy) solution.

> **Additional Restriction**: You may NOT use the Media Access API to record or otherwise persist media content from calls or meetings that your application accesses, or data derived from that media content ("record" or "recording"), without first calling the **updateRecordingStatus** API to indicate that recording has begun, and receiving a success reply from that API. If your application begins recording any meeting, it must end the recording prior to calling the **updateRecordingStatus** API to indicate that the recording has ended.

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).
