## Example

### Update the format, fill, and font properties in three table cells

The following examples demonstrate how to update properties of the [workbookRangeFormat](../resources/workbookrangeformat.md), [workbookRangeFill](../resources/workbookrangefill.md), and [workbookRangeFont](../resources/workbookrangefont.md) properties of a specified range.

The result of this set of requests is a table with three cells formatted like the top three cells in the image below.

<!--![Excel chart table with three cells whose format, fill, and font properties have been updated.](/images/ExcelRangeFormatting.png)-->
