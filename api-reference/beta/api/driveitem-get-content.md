### Response

The following example shows the response.

Returns a `302 Found` response redirecting to a preauthenticated download URL for the file.
It's the same URL available through the `@microsoft.graph.downloadUrl` property on the DriveItem.

To download the contents of the file your application needs to follow the `Location` header in the response.
Many HTTP client libraries follow the 302 redirection and start downloading the file immediately.

Preauthenticated download URLs are only valid for a short period of time (a few minutes) and don't require an `Authorization` header to download.

<!-- { "blockType": "response" } -->

```http
HTTP/1.1 302 Found
Location: https://b0mpua-by3301.files.1drv.com/y23vmagahszhxzlcvhasdhasghasodfi
```

## Downloading files in JavaScript apps
To download files in a JavaScript app, you can't use the `/content` API, because it responds with a `302` redirect.
A `302` redirect is explicitly prohibited when a [Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) _preflight_ is required, such as when providing the **Authorization** header.

Instead, your app needs to select the `@microsoft.graph.downloadUrl` property, which returns the same URL that `/content` directs to.
This URL can then be requested directly using XMLHttpRequest.
Because these URLs are preauthenticated, they can be retrieved without a CORS preflight request.

### Example

To retrieve the download URL for a file, first make a request that includes the `@microsoft.graph.downloadUrl` property:

```http
GET /drive/items/{item-ID}?select=id,@microsoft.graph.downloadUrl
```

The call returns the ID and download URL for a file:

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "id": "12319191!11919",
  "@microsoft.graph.downloadUrl": "https://..."
}
```

You can then make an XMLHttpRequest for the URL provided in `@microsoft.graph.downloadUrl` to retrieve the file.

## Partial range downloads

To download a partial range of bytes from the file, your app can use the `Range` header as specified in [RFC 2616](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616.txt).
You must append the `Range` header to the actual `@microsoft.graph.downloadUrl` URL and not to the request for `/content`.

<!-- { "blockType": "request", "opaqueUrl": true, "name": "download-item-partial", "scopes": "files.read" } -->

```http
GET https://b0mpua-by3301.files.1drv.com/y23vmag
Range: bytes=0-1023
```

The call returns an `HTTP 206 Partial Content` response with the request range of bytes from the file.
If the range can't be generated, then the Range header may be ignored and an `HTTP 200` response would be returned with the full contents of the file.

<!-- { "blockType": "response", "name": "download-item-partial", "@odata.type": "stream" } -->

```http
HTTP/1.1 206 Partial Content
Content-Range: bytes 0-1023/2048

<first 1024 bytes of file>
```
