## Optional query parameters

This method supports the following OData query parameters to help customize the response.

|Name|Value|Description|
|:---------------|:--------|:-------|
|$filter|string|Limits the response to only those people whose record contains the specified criteria.|
|$orderby|string|By default the people in the response are sorted by their relevance to your query. You can change the order of the people in the response using the *$orderby* parameter.|
|$search|string|Search for people by name or alias. Supports Fuzzy matching. Parameter only works for searching the signed-in user's relevant people, not for searching people relevant to other users.

For information and examples, see the *Perform a fuzzy search* section at [Use the People API to get information about the people most relevant to you](/graph/people-insights-overview#perform-a-fuzzy-search).|
|$select|string|Comma-separated list of properties to include in the response. For optimal performance, only select the subset of properties needed.|
|$skip|int|Skip the first n results, useful for paging. Skipping is not supported when using *$search*.|
|$top|int|The maximum number of results to be returned on a results page. For more information, see [top parameter](/graph/query-parameters?tabs=http#top-parameter).|

## Examples

### Browse

The requests in this section get the people most relevant to the signed-in user (`/me`), based on communication, collaboration, and business relationships.

    ]
}

#### Requesting a subsequent page of people

If the first response does not contain the complete list of relevant people, you can make a second request using *$top* and *$skip* to request more pages of information. If the previous request has additional information, the following request gets the next page of people from the server.

```http
GET https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/me/people/?$top=10&$skip=10
```

#### Sort the response

By default the people in the response are sorted by their relevance to your query. You can change the order of the people in the response using the *$orderby* parameter. This query selects the people most relevant to you, sorts them by their display name, and then returns the first 10 people on the sorted list.

```http
GET https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/me/people/?$orderby=DisplayName
```

#### Changing the number of people returned and the fields returned

You can change the number of people returned in the response by setting the *$top* parameter.

The following example requests the 1,000 people most relevant to `/me`. The request also limits the amount of data sent back from the server by requesting only the display name of the person.

```http
GET https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/me/people/?$top=1000&$select=DisplayName
```

#### Selecting the fields to return

You can limit the amount of data returned from the server by using the *$select* parameter to choose one or more fields. The *@odata.id* field is always returned.

The following example limits the response to the *DisplayName* and *EmailAddress* of the 10 most relevant people.

```http
GET https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/me/people/?$select=DisplayName,EmailAddresses
```

#### Using a filter to limit the response

You can use the *$filter* parameter to limit the response to only those people whose record contains the specified criteria.

The following query limits the response to people with the source "Directory."

```http
GET https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/me/people/?$filter=Sources/Any (source: source/Type  eq 'Directory')
```

#### Selecting the fields to return in a filtered response

You can combine the *$select* and *$filter* parameters to create a custom list of people relevant to the user and get only the fields that your application needs.

The following example gets the *DisplayName* and *EmailAddress* of people whose display name equals the specified name. In this example, only people whose display name equals "Nestor Kellum" are returned.

```http
+GET https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/me/people/?$select=DisplayName,EmailAddresses&$filter=DisplayName eq 'Nestor Kellum'
```

### Search people

The requests in this section also get the people most relevant to the signed-in user (`/me`). Search requests require the People.Read permission.

#### Using search to select people

Use the *$search* parameter to select people who meet a particular set of criteria.

The following search query returns people relevant to `/me` whose GivenName or Surname begins with the letter "j".

```http
GET https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/me/people/?$search=j
```

#### Using search to specify a relevant topic

The following request returns people relevant to `/me` whose name contains "ma" and who have an association with "feature planning."

```http
GET https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/me/people/?$search="ma topic: feature planning"
```

#### Performing a fuzzy search

The following request does a search for a person named "Hermaini Hall." Because there is a person named "Herminia Hull" relevant to the signed-in user, the information for "Herminia Hull" is returned.

```http
GET https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/me/people/?$search="hermaini hall"
```

### Related people

The following request gets the people most relevant to another person in the user's organization. This request requires the User.ReadBasic.All for People.Read.All permission. In this example, Nestor Kellum's relevant people are displayed.

```http
GET https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/users('nestork@contoso.com')/people/
```
