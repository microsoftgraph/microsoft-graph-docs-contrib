# Add member to team
Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Add a new [conversation member](../resources/conversationmember.md) to a [team](../resources/team.md).

> [!NOTE]
> * The **roles** property is empty by default for all members. This property only contains additional qualifiers when relevant; for example, if the member has `owner` privileges, the **roles** property contains `owner` as one of the values. Similarly, if the member is a guest, the **roles** property contains `guest` as one of the values. A basic member shouldn't have any values specified in the **roles** property.
> * After adding a new [conversation member](../resources/conversationmember.md) to a [team](../resources/team.md), it might take some time for the addition to be reflected. Users can use [change notifications](../resources/change-notifications-api-overview.md) to subscribe to notifications for membership changes in a particular team.
