# Get accessReview (deprecated)

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

[!INCLUDE [accessreviews-disclaimer](../../includes/accessreviews-disclaimer.md)]

In the Microsoft Entra [access reviews](../resources/accessreviews-root.md) feature, retrieve an [accessReview](../resources/accessreview.md) object.  

To retrieve the reviewers of the access review, use the [list accessReview reviewers](accessreview-listreviewers.md) API. To retrieve the decisions of the access review, use the [list accessReview decisions](accessreview-listdecisions.md) API, or the [list my accessReview decisions](accessreview-listmydecisions.md) API.

If this is a recurring access review, no decisions will be associated with the recurring access review series. Instead, use the `instances` relationship of that series to retrieve an [accessReview](../resources/accessreview.md) collection of the past, current, and future instances of the access review. Each past and current instance will have decisions.
