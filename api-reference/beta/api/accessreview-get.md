# Get accessReview (deprecated)

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

[!INCLUDE [accessreviews-disclaimer](../../includes/accessreviews-disclaimer.md)]

In the Azure AD [access reviews](../resources/accessreviews-root.md) feature, retrieve an [accessReview](../resources/accessreview.md) object.  

To retrieve the reviewers of the access review, use the [list accessReview reviewers](accessreview-listreviewers.md) API. To retrieve the decisions of the access review, use the [list accessReview decisions](accessreview-listdecisions.md) API, or the [list my accessReview decisions](accessreview-listmydecisions.md) API.

If this is a recurring access review, no decisions will be associated with the recurring access review series. Instead, use the `instances` relationship of that series to retrieve an [accessReview](../resources/accessreview.md) collection of the past, current, and future instances of the access review. Each past and current instance will have decisions.

## Permissions
One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

|Permission type                        | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account)     | AccessReview.Read.All, AccessReview.ReadWrite.Membership, AccessReview.ReadWrite.All  |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported. |
|Application                            | AccessReview.Read.All, AccessReview.ReadWrite.Membership  |

In order to call this API, the signed in user must also be in a directory role that permits them to read an access review, or the user can be assigned as a reviewer on the access review.  For more details, see the role and permission requirements for [access reviews](../resources/accessreviews-root.md).
