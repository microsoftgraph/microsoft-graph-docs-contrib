## HTTP request

<!-- {
  "blockType": "ignored"
}
-->
``` http
POST /security/cases/ediscoveryCases/{ediscoveryCaseId}/custodians/{custodianId}/unifiedGroupSources
```

## Request headers
|Name|Description|
|:---|:---|
|Authorization|Bearer {token}. Required. Learn more about [authentication and authorization](/graph/auth/auth-concepts).|
|Content-Type|application/json. Required.|

## Request body
In the request body, supply a JSON representation of the [unifiedGroupSource](../resources/security-unifiedgroupsource.md) object.

You can specify the following properties when you create an **unifiedGroupSource**.

>**Note:** Either **group** or **group@odata.bind** is required in order to create a **unifiedGroupSource**.

|Property|Type|Description|
|:---|:---|:---|
|includedSources|microsoft.graph.security.sourceType|Specifies which sources are included in this group. Possible values are: `mailbox`, `site`.|
|group|String|Specifies the email address for the group. To get the email address of a group, use [List groups](../api/group-list.md) or [Get group](../api/group-get.md). You can then query by the name of the group using `$filter`; for example, `https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/groups?$filter=displayName eq 'secret group'&$select=mail,id,displayName`.|
|group@odata.bind|String|ID of the group. You can get this in the same way that you get the group. |

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `201 Created` response code and an [microsoft.graph.security.unifiedGroupSource](../resources/security-unifiedgroupsource.md) object in the response body.
