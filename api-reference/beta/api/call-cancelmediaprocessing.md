# call: cancelMediaProcessing

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Cancels processing for any in-progress media operations.

Media operations refer to the IVR operations [playPrompt](./call-playprompt.md) and [recordResponse](./call-record.md), which are by default queued to process in order. The **cancelMediaProcessing** method cancels any operation that is in-process as well as operations that are queued. For example, this API can be used to clean up the IVR operation queue for a new media operation. However, it will not cancel a **ubscribeToTone** operation because it operates independent of any operation queue.
