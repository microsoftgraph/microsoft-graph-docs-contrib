# plannerBucket: delta

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Get newly created, updated, or deleted [buckets](../resources/plannerbucket.md) in a Planner [plan](../resources/plannerplan.md) without having to perform a full read of the entire resource collection. For details, see [Use delta query to track changes in Microsoft Graph data](/graph/delta-query-overview).

[!INCLUDE [national-cloud-support](../../includes/global-us.md)]

## Permissions

Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](/graph/permissions-reference).

## HTTP request

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->

```http
GET /planner/plans/{plan-id}/buckets/delta
```

## Query parameters

Tracking changes incurs a round of one or more **delta** function calls. If you use any query parameter (other than `$deltaToken` and `$skipToken`), you must specify it in the initial **delta** request. Microsoft Graph automatically encodes any specified parameters into the token portion of the `@odata.nextLink` or `@odata.deltaLink` URL provided in the response. You only need to specify any query parameters once upfront. In subsequent requests, copy and apply the `@odata.nextLink` or `@odata.deltaLink` URL from the previous response. That URL already includes the encoded parameters.

| Query parameter | Type   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| :-------------- | :----- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| $deltaToken     | string | A [state token](/graph/delta-query-overview) returned in the `@odata.deltaLink` URL of the previous **delta** function call for the same resource collection, indicating the completion of that round of change tracking. Save and apply the entire `@odata.deltaLink` URL, including this token in the first request of the next round of change tracking for that collection. |
| $skipToken      | string | A [state token](/graph/delta-query-overview) returned in the `@odata.nextLink` URL of the previous **delta** function call, indicating there are further changes to be tracked in the same resource collection.                                                                                                                                                                |

## Request headers

| Name          | Description               |
| :------------ | :------------------------ |
|Authorization|Bearer {token}. Required. Learn more about [authentication and authorization](/graph/auth/auth-concepts).|

## Request body

Don't supply a request body for this method.

## Response

If successful, this function returns a `200 OK` response code and a [plannerBucket](../resources/plannerbucket.md) collection in the response body. The response also includes a `@odata.nextLink` or a `@odata.deltaLink` URL.

- A `@odata.nextLink` URL in the response object indicates additional pages of data to be retrieved in the session. The application continues making requests using the `@odata.nextLink` URL until a `@odata.deltaLink` URL is included in the response.

- A `@odata.deltaLink` URL in the response object indicates that no more data about the existing state of the resource is returned. Persist and use the `@odata.deltaLink` URL to learn about changes to the resource in the future.

For more details, see [Use delta query to track changes in Microsoft Graph data](/graph/delta-query-overview). For an example that shows how to track changes to users, see [Get incremental changes for users](/graph/delta-query-users).
