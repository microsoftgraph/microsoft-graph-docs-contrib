# Get drive

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

A drive is the top-level container for a file system, such as OneDrive or SharePoint document libraries.

[!INCLUDE [national-cloud-support](../../includes/all-clouds.md)]

## Permissions

Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](/graph/permissions-reference).

## HTTP request

### Get the current OneDrive of a user

The signed-in user's drive (when using delegated authentication) can be accessed from the `me` singleton.

If a user has a license for OneDrive but their OneDrive isn't set up yet, this request automatically provisions the user's drive, when using delegated authentication.

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->

```http
GET /me/drive
```

### Get the OneDrive of a user

To access a user's OneDrive or OneDrive for Business, your app must request the **drive** relationship on the User resource.

If a user has a license for OneDrive but their OneDrive isn't set up yet, this request automatically provisions the user's drive, when using delegated authentication.

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->

```http
GET /users/{idOrUserPrincipalName}/drive
```

#### Path parameters

| Parameter name | Value  | Description                                       |
|:---------------|:-------|:--------------------------------------------------|
| _idOrUserPrincipalName_     | string | Required. The identifier for the user object who owns the OneDrive. |

### Get the document library associated with a group

To access a Group's default document library, your app requests the **drive** relationship on the Group.

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->

```http
GET /groups/{groupId}/drive
```

#### Path parameters

| Parameter name | Value  | Description                                       |
|:---------------|:-------|:--------------------------------------------------|
| _groupId_      | string | Required. The identifier for the group that owns the document library. |

### Get the document library for a site

To access a [Site's](../resources/site.md) default document library, your app requests the **drive** relationship on the Site.

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->

```http
GET /sites/{siteId}/drive
```
#### Path parameters

| Parameter name | Value  | Description                                       |
|:---------------|:-------|:--------------------------------------------------|
| _siteId_       | string | Required. The identifier for the site that contains the document library. |

### Get a drive by ID

If you have the unique identifier for a drive, you can access it directly from the top-level drives collection.

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->

```http
GET /drives/{driveId}
```
#### Path parameters

| Parameter name | Value  | Description                                       |
|:---------------|:-------|:--------------------------------------------------|
| _driveId_      | string | Required. The identifier for the drive requested. |

## Optional query parameters

These methods support the [$select query parameter][odata-query-parameters] to shape the response.

## Response

Each of these methods returns a [Drive resource][drive-resource] for the matching drive in the response body.

### Error response codes

If the drive doesn't exist and can't be provisioned automatically (when using delegated authentication) an `HTTP 404` response is returned.
