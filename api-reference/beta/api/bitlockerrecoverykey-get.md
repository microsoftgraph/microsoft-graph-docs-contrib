# Get bitlockerRecoveryKey
Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Retrieve the properties and relationships of a [bitlockerRecoveryKey](../resources/bitlockerrecoverykey.md) object. 

By default, this operation does not return the **key** property that represents the actual recovery key. To include the **key** property in the response, use the `$select` OData query parameter. Including the `$select` query parameter triggers an Azure AD audit of the operation and generates an audit log. You can find the log in [Azure AD audit logs](/azure/active-directory/reports-monitoring/concept-audit-logs) under the KeyManagement category.
