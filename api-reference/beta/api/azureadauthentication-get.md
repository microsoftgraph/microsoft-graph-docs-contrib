# Get azureADAuthentication
Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Read the properties and relationships of an [azureADAuthentication](../resources/azureadauthentication.md) object to find the level of Microsoft Entra authentication availability for your tenant. The Microsoft Entra service Level Agreement (SLA) commits to at least 99.99% authentication availability, as described in [Microsoft Entra SLA performance](/azure/active-directory/reports-monitoring/reference-azure-ad-sla-performance). This object provides you with your tenant's actual performance against this commitment.
