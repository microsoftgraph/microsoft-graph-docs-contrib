The resulting list includes all of the assignment requests that the caller has created for themselves or on behalf of others, such as in case of admin direct assignment, across all catalogs and access packages.

- `approver` is used to get the `accessPackageAssignmentRequest` objects where the signed-in user is an allowed approver in any contained `accessPackageAssignment/accessPackageAssignmentPolicy/requestApprovalSettings/approvalStages` (`primaryApprovers` or `escalationApprovers`). The resulting list includes the assignment requests in *pending* state, across all catalogs and access packages and that need a decision from the caller.
