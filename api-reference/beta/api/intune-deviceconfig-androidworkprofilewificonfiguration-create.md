# Create androidWorkProfileWiFiConfiguration

Namespace: microsoft.graph

> **Important:** Microsoft supports Intune /beta APIs, but they are subject to more frequent change. Microsoft recommends using version v1.0 when possible. Check an API's availability in version v1.0 using the Version selector.

> **Note:** The Microsoft Graph API for Intune requires an [active Intune license](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=839381) for the tenant.

Create a new [androidWorkProfileWiFiConfiguration](../resources/intune-deviceconfig-androidworkprofilewificonfiguration.md) object.

## HTTP Request
<!-- {
  "blockType": "ignored"
}
-->
```http
POST /deviceManagement/deviceConfigurations
POST /deviceManagement/deviceConfigurations/{deviceConfigurationId}/microsoft.graph.windowsDomainJoinConfiguration/networkAccessConfigurations
```

## Request body
In the request body, supply a JSON representation for the androidWorkProfileWiFiConfiguration object.

The following table shows the properties that are required when you create the androidWorkProfileWiFiConfiguration.

|Property|Type|Description|
|:---|:---|:---|
|id|String|Key of the entity. Inherited from [deviceConfiguration](../resources/intune-shared-deviceconfiguration.md)|
|lastModifiedDateTime|DateTimeOffset|DateTime the object was last modified. Inherited from [deviceConfiguration](../resources/intune-shared-deviceconfiguration.md)|
|roleScopeTagIds|String collection|List of Scope Tags for this Entity instance. Inherited from [deviceConfiguration](../resources/intune-shared-deviceconfiguration.md)|
|supportsScopeTags|Boolean|Indicates whether or not the underlying Device Configuration supports the assignment of scope tags. Assigning to the ScopeTags property is not allowed when this value is false and entities will not be visible to scoped users. This occurs for Legacy policies created in Silverlight and can be resolved by deleting and recreating the policy in the Azure Portal. This property is read-only. Inherited from [deviceConfiguration](../resources/intune-shared-deviceconfiguration.md)|
|deviceManagementApplicabilityRuleOsEdition|[deviceManagementApplicabilityRuleOsEdition](../resources/intune-deviceconfig-devicemanagementapplicabilityruleosedition.md)|The OS edition applicability for this Policy. Inherited from [deviceConfiguration](../resources/intune-shared-deviceconfiguration.md)|
|deviceManagementApplicabilityRuleOsVersion|[deviceManagementApplicabilityRuleOsVersion](../resources/intune-deviceconfig-devicemanagementapplicabilityruleosversion.md)|The OS version applicability rule for this Policy. Inherited from [deviceConfiguration](../resources/intune-shared-deviceconfiguration.md)|
|deviceManagementApplicabilityRuleDeviceMode|[deviceManagementApplicabilityRuleDeviceMode](../resources/intune-deviceconfig-devicemanagementapplicabilityruledevicemode.md)|The device mode applicability rule for this Policy. Inherited from [deviceConfiguration](../resources/intune-shared-deviceconfiguration.md)|
|createdDateTime|DateTimeOffset|DateTime the object was created. Inherited from [deviceConfiguration](../resources/intune-shared-deviceconfiguration.md)|
|description|String|Admin provided description of the Device Configuration. Inherited from [deviceConfiguration](../resources/intune-shared-deviceconfiguration.md)|
|displayName|String|Admin provided name of the device configuration. Inherited from [deviceConfiguration](../resources/intune-shared-deviceconfiguration.md)|
|version|Int32|Version of the device configuration. Inherited from [deviceConfiguration](../resources/intune-shared-deviceconfiguration.md)|
|networkName|String|The name of the Wi-Fi network.|
|ssid|String|This is the name of the Wi-Fi network that is broadcast to all devices.|
|connectAutomatically|Boolean|When set to true, device will connect automatically to the Wi-Fi network when in range, skipping the user prompt. When false, user will need to connect manually through Settings on the Android device. Default value is false.|
|connectWhenNetworkNameIsHidden|Boolean|When set to true, this profile forces the device to connect to a network that doesn't broadcast its SSID to all devices. When false, device will not automatically connect to hidden networks. Default value is false.|
|wiFiSecurityType|[androidWiFiSecurityType](../resources/intune-deviceconfig-androidwifisecuritytype.md)|The possible security types for Android Wi-Fi profiles. Default value Open, indicates no authentication required for the network. The security protocols supported are WEP, WPA and WPA2. WpaEnterprise and Wpa2Enterprise options are available for Enterprise Wi-Fi profiles. Wep and WpaPersonal (supports WPA and WPA2) options are available for Basic Wi-Fi profiles. The possible values are: `open`, `wpaEnterprise`, `wpa2Enterprise`, `wep`, `wpaPersonal`, `unknownFutureValue`.|
|preSharedKey|String|Specify the pre-shared key for a WEP or WPA personal Wi-Fi network. Restrictions depend on the value set for wiFiSecurityType. If WEP type security is used, then preSharedKey must be a valid passphrase (5 or 13 characters) or a valid HEX key (10 or 26 hexidecimal characters). If WPA security type is used, then preSharedKey can be any string between 8 and 64 characters long.|
|preSharedKeyIsSet|Boolean|When set to true, indicates that the pre-shared key is configured. When set to false, indicates that pre-shared key is not configured (any values set for preSharedKey will be ignored). Default value is false.|
|proxySettings|[wiFiProxySetting](../resources/intune-deviceconfig-wifiproxysetting.md)|Proxy Type for this Wi-Fi connection. The possible values are: `none`, `manual`, `automatic`, `unknownFutureValue`.|
|proxyAutomaticConfigurationUrl|String|URL of the proxy server automatic configuration script when automatic configuration is selected. This URL is typically the location of PAC (Proxy Auto Configuration) file.|
