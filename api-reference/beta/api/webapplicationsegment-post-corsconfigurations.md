``` http
POST /applications/{applicationObjectId}/onPremisesPublishing/segmentsConfiguration/microsoft.graph.webSegmentConfiguration/applicationSegments/{webApplicationSegment-id}/corsConfigurations
```

## Request headers

|Name|Description|
|:---|:---|
|Authorization|Bearer {token}. Required. Learn more about [authentication and authorization](/graph/auth/auth-concepts).|
|Content-Type|application/json. Required.|

## Request body

In the request body, supply a JSON representation of the [corsConfiguration_v2](../resources/corsconfiguration_v2.md) object.

You can specify the following properties when creating a **corsConfiguration_v2**.

|Property|Type|Description|
|:---|:---|:---|
|resource|String|Resource within the application segment for which CORS permissions are granted. `/` grants permission for the whole app segment. Required.|
|allowedOrigins|String collection|The origin domains that are permitted to make a request against the service via CORS. The origin domain is the domain from which the request originates. The origin must be an exact case-sensitive match with the origin that the user agent sends to the service. Optional.|
|allowedHeaders|String collection|The request headers that the origin domain may specify on the CORS request. The wildcard character `*` indicates that any header beginning with the specified prefix is allowed. Optional.|
|allowedMethods|String collection|The HTTP request methods that the origin domain may use for a CORS request. Optional.|
|maxAgeInSeconds|Int32|The maximum amount of time that a browser should cache the response to the preflight **OPTIONS** request. Optional.|



## Response

If successful, this method returns a `201 Created` response code and a [corsConfiguration_v2](../resources/corsconfiguration_v2.md) object in the response body.

      Error: microsoft.graph.microsoft.graph/applications:
        /applications/{var}/onPremisesPublishing/segmentsConfiguration/microsoft.graph.webSegmentConfiguration/applicationSegments/{var}/corsConfigurations
        Uri path requires navigating into unknown object hierarchy: missing property 'microsoft.graph.webSegmentConfiguration' on 'segmentConfiguration'. Possible issues:
        1) Doc bug where 'microsoft.graph.webSegmentConfiguration' isn't defined on the resource.
        2) Doc bug where 'microsoft.graph.webSegmentConfiguration' is an example key and should instead be replaced with a placeholder like {item-id} or declared in the sampleKeys annotation.
        3) Doc bug where 'segmentConfiguration' is supposed to be an entity type, but is being treated as a complex because it (and its ancestors) are missing the keyProperty annotation.
