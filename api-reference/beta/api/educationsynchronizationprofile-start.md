# Start sync after uploading files to an educationSynchronizationProfile

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Verify the files uploaded to a specific school data [synchronization profile](../resources/educationsynchronizationprofile.md) in the tenant. If the verification is successful, synchronization starts on the profile. Otherwise, the response contains errors and warnings. If the response contains errors, the synchronization won't start. If the response contains only warnings, synchronization starts.

> **Note:** Use this method only when the data provider is of type [educationcsvdataprovider](../resources/educationcsvdataprovider.md). Also, the profile's state property needs to be provisioned before it can be started. Poll the profile object to check its state property.
