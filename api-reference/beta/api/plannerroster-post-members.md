[!INCLUDE [permissions-table](../includes/permissions/plannerroster-post-members-permissions.md)]

## HTTP request

<!-- {
  "blockType": "ignored"
}
-->
``` http
POST /planner/rosters/{plannerRosterId}/members
```

## Request headers

|Name|Description|
|:---|:---|
|Authorization|Bearer {token}. Required. Learn more about [authentication and authorization](/graph/auth/auth-concepts).|
|Content-Type|application/json. Required.|

## Request body

In the request body, supply a JSON representation of the [plannerRosterMember](../resources/plannerrostermember.md) object.

The following table lists the properties that are required when you create the [plannerRosterMember](../resources/plannerrostermember.md).

|Property|Type|Description|
|:---|:---|:---|
|roles|String collection|Other roles assigned to the user. Optional. Currently, no other roles are available for users.|
|tenantId|String|Identifier of the tenant the user belongs to. Optional. Currently, roster members can't be from different tenants.|

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `201 Created` response code and a [plannerRosterMember](../resources/plannerrostermember.md) object in the response body.

This method returns a `403 Forbidden` response code if the sensitivity label on the roster disallows the addition of guests and the request adds guests to the **plannerRoster**. The request fails, and the **code** property in the error resource type has the value `addingGuestUsersProhibitedByLabel`.
