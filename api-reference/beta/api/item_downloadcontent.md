can be downloaded.

## Prerequisites
One of the following **scopes** is required to execute this API:

  * Files.Read
  * Files.ReadWrite

### HTTP request

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
GET /me/drive/items/{item-id}/content
GET /me/drive/root:/{item-path and filename}:/content
GET /groups/<id>/drive/items/<item-id>/content
```

### Request headers

| Name          | Value  | Description                                                                                                                                              |
|:--------------|:-------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Authorization | string | Bearer <token>. Required.                                                                                                                                |
| If-none-match | String | If this request header is included and the eTag (or cTag) provided matches the current tag on the file, an `HTTP 304 Not Modified` response is returned. |
| Range         | range  | Range of bytes returned in the response.                                                                                                                 |


### Request body
Do not supply a request body for this method.

### Example
Here is an example of how to call this API.


<!-- { "blockType": "request", "name": "driveitem-download-contents" } -->
```http
GET /me/drive/items/{item-id}/content
```

##### Response
Returns a `302 Found` response redirecting to a pre-authenticated download URL
for the file. This is the same URL available through the `@content.downloadUrl`
property on an item.

To download the contents of the file your application will need to follow
the `Location` header in the response.

Pre-authenticated download URLs are only valid for a short period of time (a few
minutes) and do not require an `Authorization` header to download.

<!-- { "blockType": "response", "@odata.type": "stream" } -->
```http
HTTP/1.1 302 Found
Location: https://b0mpua-by3301.files.1drv.com/y23vmagahszhxzlcvhasdhasghasodfi
```

### Range downloads

To download a partial range of an item, you use the Range HTTP header as
specified in [RFC 2616](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616.txt). Note that you
must append the Range header to the HTTP request after receiving the `302 Found`.

<!-- { "blockType": "request", "name": "driveitem-get-partial-content" } -->
```http
GET https://b0mpua-by3301.files.1drv.com/y23vmag
Range: bytes=0-1023
```

This will return an `HTTP 206 Partial Content` response with the request range
of bytes from the file. If the range cannot be generated the Range header may be
ignored and an `HTTP 200` response would be returned with the full contents of
the file.

<!-- { "blockType": "response", "@odata.type": "stream" } -->
```http
HTTP/1.1 206 Partial Content
Content-Range: bytes 0-1023/2048

<first 1024 bytes of file>
```

## Notes  

When you download an item's content by requesting its /content property, you
must provide the Authorization header, in order to be granted access to
download. The response would normally return a `302` redirect to the URL where
the file can be downloaded from. This URL is pre-authenticated and does not
require the Authorization header.
