# Create domain

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Adds a domain to the tenant.

**Important**: You cannot use an associated domain with your Microsoft Entra tenant until ownership is verified. See [List verificationDnsRecords](domain-list-verificationdnsrecords.md) for details. Root domains require verification. For example, contoso.com requires verification. If a root domain is verified, subdomains of the root domain are automatically verified. For example, subdomain.contoso.com is automatically be verified if contoso.com has been verified.
