# Upsert group

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Create a new [group](../resources/group.md) object if it doesn't exist, or update the properties of an existing [group](../resources/group.md) object.
You can create or update the following types of group:

- Microsoft 365 group (unified group)
- Security group

 By default, this operation returns only a subset of the properties for each group. For a list of properties that are returned by default, see the [Properties](../resources/group.md#properties) section of the [group](../resources/group.md) resource. To get properties that are _not_ returned by default, do a [GET operation](group-get.md) and specify the properties in a `$select` OData query option.

> **Note**: To create a [team](../resources/team.md), first create a group, and then add a team to it. For more information, see [Create team](../api/team-put-teams.md).

## Permissions

Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](/graph/permissions-reference).

<!-- { "blockType": "permissions", "name": "group_upsert" } -->
[!INCLUDE [permissions-table](../includes/permissions/group-upsert-permissions.md)]

In order for an app with Group.Create permission to create a group with owners or members, it must have the privileges to read the object type that it wants to assign as the group owner or member. Therefore:

- The app can assign itself as the group's owner or member.
- To create the group with users as owners or members, the app must have at least the *User.Read.All* permission.
- To create the group with other service principals as owners or members, the app must have at least the *Application.Read.All* permission.
- To create the group with either users or service principals as owners or members, the app must have at least the *Directory.Read.All* permission.

## HTTP request

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->

``` http
PATCH /groups/(uniqueName='uniqueName')
```

## Request headers

| Name          | Description  |
|:--------------|:---|
| Authorization |Bearer {token}. Required. Learn more about [authentication and authorization](/graph/auth/auth-concepts).|
| Content-Type  | application/json. Required.|
| Prefer        | `create-if-missing`. Required for upsert behavior, otherwise the request is treated as an update operation. |

## Request body

In the request body, supply a JSON representation of the [group](../resources/group.md) object.

The following table lists the properties that are required when you create the [group](../resources/group.md). Specify other writable properties as necessary for your group on creation or update.

| Property        | Type    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| :-------------- | :------ | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| displayName     | String  | The name to display in the address book for the group. Maximum length is 256 characters. Required.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| mailEnabled     | Boolean | Set to `true` for mail-enabled groups. Required.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| mailNickname    | String  | The mail alias for the group, unique for Microsoft 365 groups in the organization. Maximum length is 64 characters. This property can contain only characters in the [ASCII character set 0 - 127](/office/vba/language/reference/user-interface-help/character-set-0127) except the following: ` @ () \ [] " ; : <> , SPACE`. Required. |
| securityEnabled | Boolean | Set to `true` for security-enabled groups, including Microsoft 365 groups. Required. **Note:** Groups created using the Microsoft Entra admin center or the Azure portal always have **securityEnabled** initially set to `true`.                                                                                                                                    |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - Creating a group using the **Group.Create** application permission without specifying owners will create the group anonymously and the group will not be modifiable. Add owners to the group while creating it to specify owners who can modify the group.
> - Creating a Microsoft 365 group programmatically with an app-only context and without specifying owners will create the group anonymously. Doing so can result in the associated SharePoint Online site not being created automatically until further manual action is taken.
> - A non-admin user can't add themselves to the group owners collection. For more information, see the related [known issue](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/known-issues/?search=26419).
> - The following properties can't be set in the initial POST request and must be set in a subsequent PATCH request: **allowExternalSenders**, **autoSubscribeNewMembers**, **hideFromAddressLists**, **hideFromOutlookClients**, **isSubscribedByMail**, **unseenCount**.

Because the **group** resource supports [extensions](/graph/extensibility-overview), you can add custom properties with your own data to the group while creating it.

### groupTypes options

Use the **groupTypes** property to control the type of group and its membership, as shown.

| Type of group                     | Assigned membership | Dynamic membership                |
| :-------------------------------- | :------------------ | :-------------------------------- |
| Microsoft 365 (aka unified group) | `["Unified"]`       | `["Unified","DynamicMembership"]` |
| Dynamic                           | `[]` (_null_)       | `["DynamicMembership"]`           |

## Response

If an object with the **uniqueName** doesn't exist, this method returns a `201 Created` response code and a new [group](../resources/group.md) object in the response body.

If an object with **uniqueName** doesn't exist and the `Prefer: create-if-missing` header is *not* specified, this method returns a `404 Not Found` error code.

If an object with the **uniqueName** already exists, this method updates the [group](../resources/group.md) object and returns a `204 No Content` response code.

## Examples

### Example 1: Create a Microsoft 365 group if it doesn't exist

The following example creates a Microsoft 365 group because a group with the specified **uniqueName** value does not exist. Because the owners have not been specified, the calling user is automatically added as the owner of the group.

### Example 2: Create a security group with an owner and members if it doesn't exist

The following example creates a security group with an owner and members specified because a group with the specified **uniqueName** value does not exist. Note that a maximum of 20 relationships, such as owners and members, can be added as part of group creation. You can subsequently add multiple additional members by using the [add member](/graph/api/group-post-members?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) API or JSON batching.

A non-admin user can't add themselves to the group owners collection. For more information, see the related [known issue](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/known-issues/?search=26419).
