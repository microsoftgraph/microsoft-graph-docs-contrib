# Delete program

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

In the Azure AD [access reviews](../resources/accessreviews-root.md) feature, delete a [program](../resources/program.md) object.

Do not delete a program which still has `programControl` linked to it, those access reviews should first be deleted or unlinked from the program and linked to a different program.  Also, please note that the built-in default program cannot be deleted.
