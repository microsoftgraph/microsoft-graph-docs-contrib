# List group members

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Get a list of the [group's](../resources/group.md) direct members. A group can have users, contacts, devices, service principals, and other groups as members. This operation isn't transitive.

[!INCLUDE [national-cloud-support](../../includes/all-clouds.md)]

## Permissions

Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](/graph/permissions-reference).

<!-- { "blockType": "permissions", "name": "group_list_members" } -->
[!INCLUDE [permissions-table](../includes/permissions/group-list-members-permissions.md)]

[!INCLUDE [limited-info](../../includes/limited-info.md)]

In delegated scenarios, the signed-in user must also be assigned a supported [Microsoft Entra role](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference?toc=%2Fgraph%2Ftoc.json) or a custom role with the `microsoft.directory/groups/members/read` or `microsoft.directory/groups/members/limitedRead` role permission, or `microsoft.directory/groups/hiddenMembers/read` role permission to read hidden members. The following least privileged roles are supported for this operation:

- Group owners
- "Member" users
- "Guest" users - have [limited read permissions](/entra/fundamentals/users-default-permissions?context=graph/context#compare-member-and-guest-default-permissions)
- Directory Readers
- Directory Writers
- Groups Administrator
- User Administrator - Including hidden members
- Exchange Administrator - Including hidden members
- SharePoint Administrator - Including hidden members 
- Intune Administrator - Including hidden members
- Teams Administrator - Including hidden members
- Yammer Administrator - Including hidden members

To list the members of a hidden membership group, the *Member.Read.Hidden* permission is also required.

## HTTP request

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->

```http
GET /groups/{id}/members
```

## Optional query parameters

This method supports the `$filter`, `$count`, `$select`, `$search`, `$top`, and `$expand` [OData query parameters](/graph/query-parameters) to help customize the response.
- OData cast is enabled. For example, `/groups/{id}/members/microsoft.graph.user` retrieves group members that are users.
- `$search` is supported on the **displayName** and **description** properties only.
- The default and maximum page size is 100 and 999 group objects respectively.
- The use of query parameters with this API, except for `$expand`, is supported only with advanced query parameters. `$expand` isn't supported with advanced query parameters. For more information, see [Advanced query capabilities on directory objects](/graph/aad-advanced-queries).

## Request headers

| Name             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| :--------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|Authorization|Bearer {token}. Required. Learn more about [authentication and authorization](/graph/auth/auth-concepts).|
| ConsistencyLevel | eventual. This header and `$count` are required when using the `$search`, `$filter`, `$orderby`, or OData cast query parameters. It uses an index that might not be up-to-date with recent changes to the object. |

## Request body

Don't supply a request body for this method.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and collection of [directoryObject](../resources/directoryobject.md) objects in the response body.

An attempt to filter by an OData cast that represents an unsupported member type returns a `400 Bad Request` error with the `Request_UnsupportedQuery` code. For example, `/groups/{id}}/members/microsoft.graph.group` when the group is a Microsoft 365 group returns this error, because Microsoft 365 groups can't have other groups as members.
