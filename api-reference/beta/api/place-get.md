# Get place

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Read the properties of a [place](../resources/place.md) object specified by its ID.

The **place** object can be one of the following types:

* A [building](../resources/building.md), which includes rich properties such as resource links and has a wireless network.
* A [floor](../resources/floor.md), which includes rich properties such as sort order.
* A [section](../resources/section.md).
* A [desk](../resources/desk.md), which includes rich properties such as mailbox details and mode.
* A [room](../resources/room.md), which includes rich properties such as an email address for the room, and accessibility, capacity, and device support. 
* A [workspace](../resources/workspace.md), which includes properties such as an email address for the workspace, and accessibility and capacity. 
* A [roomList](../resources/roomlist.md), which includes an email address for the room list, and a navigation property to get the collection of **room** instances in that room list.

The listed resources are derived from the **place** object.
