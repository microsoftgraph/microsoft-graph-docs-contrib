# List submission resources

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

List the resources associated with a submission. 

The **submissionResource** object is a wrapper around the actual resource object the student is working on. The wrapper also includes a pointer to the resources on the assignment if this was copied from the assignment during the assign process. These resources are the working copy of the assignment. The **submittedResources** are the resources that have officially been submitted to be graded.
