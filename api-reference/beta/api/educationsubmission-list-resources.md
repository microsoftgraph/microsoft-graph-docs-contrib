# List submission resources

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

List the resources associated with a submission. Only teachers, students, and applications with application permissions can perform this operation.

The [educationSubmissionResource](../resources/educationsubmissionresource.md) object is a wrapper around the actual resource object the student is working on. The wrapper also includes a pointer to the resources on the assignment if the resource was copied from the assignment during the assign process. These resources are the working copy of the assignment. The **submittedResources** are the resources that were officially submitted for grading.

[!INCLUDE [national-cloud-support](../../includes/global-only.md)]
