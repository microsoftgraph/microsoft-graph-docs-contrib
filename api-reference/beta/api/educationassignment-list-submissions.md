# List submissions

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

List all the [submission](../resources/educationsubmission.md) objects associated with an [assignment](../resources/educationassignment.md). Only teachers, students, and applications with application permissions can perform this operation.

A teacher or an application with application permissions can get all the **submissions**, a student can only get **submissions** that they're associated with.

Provide the header `Prefer: include-unknown-enum-members` to properly list **submissions** with the `reassigned` status. For details, see the examples section.

[!INCLUDE [national-cloud-support](../../includes/global-only.md)]

Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](/graph/permissions-reference).
