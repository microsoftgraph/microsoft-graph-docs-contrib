# Assign tokenLifetimePolicy

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Assign a [tokenLifetimePolicy](../resources/tokenlifetimepolicy.md) to an [application](../resources/application.md) or [servicePrincipal](../resources/servicePrincipal.md). You can have multiple tokenLifetimePolicy policies in a tenant but can assign only one tokenLifetimePolicy per application.

You can address the application using either its **id** or **appId**. **id** and **appId** are referred to as the **Object ID** and **Application (Client) ID**, respectively, in app registrations in the Microsoft Entra admin center.
