# Update accessReview (deprecated)

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

[!INCLUDE [accessreviews-disclaimer](../../includes/accessreviews-disclaimer.md)]

In the Microsoft Entra [access reviews](../resources/accessreviews-root.md) feature, update an existing [accessReview](../resources/accessreview.md) object to change one or more of its properties.

This API is not intended to change the reviewers or decisions of a review.  To change the reviewers, use the [addReviewer](accessreview-addreviewer.md) or [removeReviewer](accessreview-removereviewer.md) APIs.  To stop an already-started one-time review, or an already-started instance of a recurring review, early, use the [stop](accessreview-stop.md) API. To apply the decisions to the target group or app access rights, use the [apply](accessreview-apply.md) API. 


[!INCLUDE [national-cloud-support](../../includes/all-clouds.md)]

## Permissions
Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](/graph/permissions-reference).
