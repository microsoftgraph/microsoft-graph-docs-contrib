# Get schedule

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Retrieve the properties and relationships of a [schedule](../resources/schedule.md) object.

The schedule creation process conforms to the [One API guideline for resource based long running operations (RELO)](https://github.com/Microsoft/api-guidelines/blob/master/Guidelines.md#131-resource-based-long-running-operations-relo).
When clients use the [PUT method](team-put-schedule.md), if the schedule is provisioned, the operation updates the schedule; otherwise, the operation starts the schedule provisioning process in the background.

During schedule provisioning, clients can use the GET method to get the schedule and look at the `provisionStatus` property for the current state of the provisioning. If the provisioning failed, clients can get additional information from the `provisionStatusCode` property.

Clients can also inspect the configuration of the schedule.
