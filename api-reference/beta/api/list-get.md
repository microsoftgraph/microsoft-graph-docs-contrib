The following example shows how to get metadata for a list that contains three columns: Name, Quantity, and Category.
[Managed Metadata](/sharepoint/managed-metadata) columns like ```Category``` return values as term ID and term name pair.
```http
GET /sites/{site-id}/lists/{list-id}?select=name,lastModifiedDateTime&expand=columns(select=name,description),items(expand=fields(select=Name,Quantity,Category))
```
