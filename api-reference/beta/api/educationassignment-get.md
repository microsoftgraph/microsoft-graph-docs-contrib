# Get educationAssignment

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Get the properties and relationships of an [assignment](../resources/educationassignment.md). Only teachers, students, and applications with application permissions can perform this operation.

Students can only see assignments assigned to them; teachers and applications with application permissions can see all assignments in a class.

You can use the `Prefer` header in your request to get the `inactive` status in case the assignment is deactivated; otherwise, the response value for the **status** property is `unknownFutureValue`.

[!INCLUDE [national-cloud-support](../../includes/global-only.md)]

## Permissions
Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](/graph/permissions-reference).

[!INCLUDE [permissions-table](../includes/permissions/educationassignment-get-permissions.md)]

## HTTP request
<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
GET /education/classes/{id}/assignments/{id}
```
## Optional query parameters
This method supports the `$select`, `$orderby`, and `$expand` OData query parameters to help customize the response. For general information, see [OData query parameters](/graph/query-parameters).

You can use `$orderby` with the following properties of the [educationAssignment](../resources/educationassignment.md) resource: **assignDateTime**, **assignedDateTime**, **closeDateTime**, **createdDateTime**, **displayName**, **dueDateTime**, **lastModifiedDateTime**, **moduleUrl**, and **status**.

The following `$expand` options are available for this method: `categories`, `resources`, `rubric`, `submissions`, `gradingScheme`, `gradingCategory`, and `*`. `*` specifies all the previous options.

## Request headers
| Header       | Value |
|:---------------|:--------|
|Authorization|Bearer {token}. Required. Learn more about [authentication and authorization](/graph/auth/auth-concepts).|
| Prefer        | include-unknown-enum-members. Optional. |

## Request body
Don't supply a request body for this method.

## Response
If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and an [educationAssignment](../resources/educationassignment.md) object in the response body.
