# teamsAppInstallation: upgrade

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Upgrade an [app installation](../resources/teamsappinstallation.md) within a [chat](../resources/chat.md).

> **Note:**
> - If the chat is associated with an [onlineMeeting](../resources/onlinemeeting.md) instance, then effectively, the **teamsApp** installed in the meeting gets upgraded.

[!INCLUDE [national-cloud-support](../../includes/all-clouds.md)]

## Permissions

Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](/graph/permissions-reference).

[!INCLUDE [permissions-table](../includes/permissions/chat-teamsappinstallation-upgrade-permissions.md)]

> [!NOTE]
> - The TeamsAppInstallation.ReadWriteSelfForChat, TeamsAppInstallation.ReadWriteForChat, TeamsAppInstallation.ReadWriteSelfForChat.All, and TeamsAppInstallation.ReadWriteForChat.All permissions can't be used to install apps that require consent to resource-specific permissions.
> - The Chat.Manage.Chat permission uses [resource-specific consent](/microsoftteams/platform/graph-api/rsc/resource-specific-consent).

## HTTP request

> **Note:**
> The permissions consented to during the upgrade must be the same as the resource-specific permissions present in the [teamsAppDefinition](../resources/teamsAppDefinition.md) of the app. To get the application and delegated resource-specific permissions, see [Example 7](../api/appcatalogs-list-teamsapps.md#example-7-list-applications-with-a-given-id-and-return-only-the-resource-specific-permissions-required-by-the-app).
