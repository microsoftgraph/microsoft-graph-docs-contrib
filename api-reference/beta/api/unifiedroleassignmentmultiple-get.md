# Get unifiedRoleAssignmentMultiple

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Get the properties and relationships of a [unifiedRoleAssignmentMultiple](../resources/unifiedroleassignmentmultiple.md) object of an RBAC provider. 

The following RBAC providers are currently supported:
- Cloud PC 
- device management (Intune)

For other Microsoft 365 applications (like Azure AD), use [unifiedRoleAssignment](../resources/unifiedroleassignment.md).

## Permissions

Depending on the RBAC provider and the permission type (delegated or application) that is needed, choose from the following table the least privileged permission required to call this API. To learn more, including [taking caution](/graph/auth/auth-concepts#best-practices-for-requesting-permissions) before choosing more privileged permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference). 

### For Cloud PC provider

|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) |  CloudPC.Read.All, CloudPC.ReadWrite.All   |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported.    |
|Application | CloudPC.Read.All, CloudPC.ReadWrite.All  |

### For Device management (Intune) provider

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
