# Get unifiedRoleAssignmentMultiple

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Get the properties and relationships of a [unifiedRoleAssignmentMultiple](../resources/unifiedroleassignmentmultiple.md) object of an RBAC provider. 

The following RBAC providers are currently supported:
- Cloud PC 
- device management (Intune)

For other Microsoft 365 applications (like Microsoft Entra ID), use [unifiedRoleAssignment](../resources/unifiedroleassignment.md).

[!INCLUDE [national-cloud-support](../../includes/all-clouds.md)]
