# Update organization

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Update the properties of the currently authenticated organization. In this case, `organization` is defined as a collection of exactly one record, and so its **ID** must be specified in the request.  The **ID** is also known as the **tenantId** of the organization.

[!INCLUDE [national-cloud-support](../../includes/all-clouds.md)]

## Request body

In the request body, supply the values for relevant fields that should be updated. Existing properties that are not included in the request body will maintain their previous values or be recalculated based on changes to other property values. For best performance you shouldn't include existing values that haven't changed.

Since the **organization** resource supports [extensions](/graph/extensibility-overview), you can use the `PATCH` operation to 
add, update, or delete your own app-specific data in custom properties of an extension in an existing **organization** instance.

## Response

If successful, this method returns `204 No Content` response code. It doesn't return anything in the response body.
