# Create unifiedRoleAssignmentMultiple

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Create a new [unifiedRoleAssignmentMultiple](../resources/unifiedroleassignmentmultiple.md) object for an RBAC provider. 

The following RBAC providers are currently supported:
- Cloud PC 
- device management (Intune)

For other Microsoft 365 applications (like Azure AD), use [unifiedRoleAssignment](../resources/unifiedroleassignment.md).

[!INCLUDE [cloudpc-api-preview](../../includes/cloudpc-api-preview.md)]

## Permissions

Depending on the RBAC provider and the permission type (delegated or application) that is needed, choose from the following table the least privileged permission required to call this API. To learn more, including [taking caution](/graph/auth/auth-concepts#best-practices-for-requesting-permissions) before choosing more privileged permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference). 

### For Cloud PC provider

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) |  CloudPC.ReadWrite.All   |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported.    |
|Application | CloudPC.ReadWrite.All  |

### For Device management (Intune) provider

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) |  DeviceManagementRBAC.ReadWrite.All   |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported.    |
|Application | DeviceManagementRBAC.ReadWrite.All |


## HTTP request

To create role assignment for a Cloud PC provider:

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->

```http
POST /roleManagement/cloudPC/roleAssignments
```

To create role assignment for an Intune provider:
<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->

```http
POST /roleManagement/deviceManagement/roleAssignments
```

## Request headers

| Name | Description |
|:---- |:----------- |
| Authorization | Bearer {token}. Required. |
| Content-type | application/json. Required. |

## Request body

In the request body, supply a JSON representation of [unifiedRoleAssignmentMultiple](../resources/unifiedroleassignmentmultiple.md) object. The request must have either a scope defined in Azure AD, such as `directoryScopeIds`, or an application-specific scope, such as `appScopeId`. Examples of Azure AD scope are tenant ("/"), administrative units, or applications. 

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `201 Created` response code and a new [unifiedRoleAssignmentMultiple](../resources/unifiedroleassignmentmultiple.md) object in the response body.

## Examples

### Example 1: Create a role assignment in Intune over two scope groups (which are Azure AD objects)

#### Request

The following is an example of the request.
> **Note:** the use of the **roleTemplateId** for **roleDefinitionId**. **roleDefinitionId** can be either the service-wide template ID or the directory-specific **roleDefinitionId**.

### Example 2: Create a role assignment in Intune at Intune-specific scope of "all Devices"

Use the following information for creating Intune role assignments:
- To allow assignments over all Intune devices, use the `AllDevices` value in **appScopeIds**.
- To allow assignments over all Intune licensed users, use the `AllLicensedUsers` value in **appScopeIds**.
- To allow assignments over all Intune devices and licensed users, use the `/` value in **directoryScopeIds**.
