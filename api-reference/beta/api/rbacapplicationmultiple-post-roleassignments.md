# Create unifiedRoleAssignmentMultiple

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Create a new [unifiedRoleAssignmentMultiple](../resources/unifiedroleassignmentmultiple.md) object for an RBAC provider. 

The following RBAC providers are currently supported:
- Cloud PC 
- device management (Intune)
- Defender (Microsoft Defender XDR)

For other Microsoft 365 applications (like Microsoft Entra ID), use [unifiedRoleAssignment](../resources/unifiedroleassignment.md).

[!INCLUDE [national-cloud-support](../../includes/all-clouds.md)]

## Permissions

The following tables show the least privileged permission or permissions required to call this API on each supported resource type. Follow [best practices](/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions) to request least privileged permissions. For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](/graph/permissions-reference).

### For Cloud PC provider

<!-- { "blockType": "permissions", "name": "rbacapplicationmultiple_post_roleassignments" } -->
[!INCLUDE [permissions-table](../includes/permissions/rbacapplicationmultiple-post-roleassignments-permissions.md)]

### For Device management (Intune) provider

<!-- { "blockType": "permissions", "name": "rbacapplicationmultiple_post_roleassignments_2" } -->
[!INCLUDE [permissions-table](../includes/permissions/rbacapplicationmultiple-post-roleassignments-2-permissions.md)]

### For Defender provider

<!-- { "blockType": "permissions", "name": "rbacapplicationmultiple_post_roleassignments_3" } -->
[!INCLUDE [permissions-table](../includes/permissions/rbacapplicationmultiple-post-roleassignments-3-permissions.md)]

## HTTP request

To create role assignment for a Cloud PC provider:

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->

```http
POST /roleManagement/cloudPC/roleAssignments
```

To create role assignment for an Intune provider:
<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->

```http
POST /roleManagement/deviceManagement/roleAssignments
```

To create role assignment for a Defender provider:
<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->

```http
POST /roleManagement/defender/roleAssignments
```

## Request headers

| Name | Description |
|:---- |:----------- |
|Authorization|Bearer {token}. Required. Learn more about [authentication and authorization](/graph/auth/auth-concepts).|
| Content-type | application/json. Required. |

## Request body

In the request body, supply a JSON representation of [unifiedRoleAssignmentMultiple](../resources/unifiedroleassignmentmultiple.md) object. The request must have either a scope defined in Microsoft Entra ID, such as `directoryScopeIds`, or an application-specific scope, such as `appScopeId`. Examples of Microsoft Entra scope are tenant ("/"), administrative units, or applications. 

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `201 Created` response code and a new [unifiedRoleAssignmentMultiple](../resources/unifiedroleassignmentmultiple.md) object in the response body.

## Examples

<a name='example-1-create-a-role-assignment-in-intune-over-two-scope-groups-which-are-azure-ad-objects'></a>

### Example 1: Create a role assignment in Intune over two scope groups (which are Microsoft Entra objects)

#### Request

The following example shows a request.
> **Note:** the use of the **roleTemplateId** for **roleDefinitionId**. **roleDefinitionId** can be either the service-wide template ID or the directory-specific **roleDefinitionId**.

### Example 2: Create a role assignment in Intune at Intune-specific scope of "all Devices"

Use the following information for creating Intune role assignments:
- To allow assignments over all Intune devices, use the `AllDevices` value in **appScopeIds**.
- To allow assignments over all Intune licensed users, use the `AllLicensedUsers` value in **appScopeIds**.
- To allow assignments over all Intune devices and licensed users, use the `/` value in **directoryScopeIds**.

- To allow assignments over workload, on all scopes, don't add any scope after the following workload IDs in **appScopeIds**: `Mdi`, `Mdc`, `Mda`, `Mde`, `Mdo`, `SecureScoreExternal`.
- To allow assignments over all current and future workloads, on specific scope, use one of the following values in **directoryScopeIds**: `/`, `ScopeType`, `ScopeId` .
