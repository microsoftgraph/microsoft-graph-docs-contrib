# Get user activities

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Get activities for a given user. Unlike the **recent** OData function, activities without histories will be returned. The permission UserActivity.ReadWrite.CreatedByApp will apply extra filtering to the response, so that only activities created by your application are returned. This server-side filtering might result in empty pages if the user is particularly active and other applications have created more recent activities. To get your application's activities, use the **nextLink** property to paginate.
