# List appRoleAssignments granted to a user

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Retrieve the list of [appRoleAssignments](../resources/approleassignment.md) that a [user](../resources/user.md) has been granted. This operation also returns app role assignments granted to groups that the user is a direct member of.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To ensure complete results for users with many indirect app role assignments, use the **ConsistencyLevel** header set to `eventual` and `$count`, as described in [Advanced query capabilities on Azure AD directory objects](/graph/aad-advanced-queries#group-properties). For an example, see [Example 1](#example-1-list-approleassignments-granted-to-a-user).
