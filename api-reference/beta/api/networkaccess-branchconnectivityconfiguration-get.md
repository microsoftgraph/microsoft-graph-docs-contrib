# Get branchConnectivityConfiguration (deprecated)
Namespace: microsoft.graph.networkaccess

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Deprecated and to be retired soon. Use the [remoteNetworkConnectivityConfiguration resource type](../resources/networkaccess-remotenetworkconnectivityconfiguration.md) and its associated methods instead.

Retrieve the IPSec tunnel configuration required to establish a bidirectional communication link between your organization's router and the Microsoft gateway. This information is vital for configuring your router (customer premise equipment) after creating a [deviceLink](../resources/networkaccess-devicelink.md).
