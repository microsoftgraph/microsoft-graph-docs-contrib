## Request body

Don't supply a request body for this method.

## Response

If successful, this function returns a `200 OK` response code and a collection of [microsoft.graph.callRecords.pstnOnlineMeetingDialoutReport](../resources/callrecords-pstnonlinemeetingdialoutreport.md) entries in the response body.
  
If the function returns more than 1,000 entries for the specified date range, the body also includes an `@odata.nextLink` with a URL to query the next page of entries. The last page in the date range doesn't have an `@odata.nextLink`. For more information, see [paging Microsoft Graph data in your app](/graph/paging).

## Example

The following example shows how to get the aggregated report for the audio conferencing dial-out service over a specified date range. The response includes `"@odata.count": 1000` to enumerate the number of records in this first response, and an `@odata.nextLink` to get records beyond the first 1,000. For readability, the response object contains only a collection of one record.
