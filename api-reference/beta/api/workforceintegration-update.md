For best performance, don't include existing values that haven't changed.

| Property     | Type        | Description |
|:-------------|:------------|:------------|
|apiVersion|Int32|API version for the call back url. Start with 1.|
|displayName|String|Name of the workforce integration.|
|encryption|workforceIntegrationEncryption|The workforce integration encryption resource. |
|isActive|Boolean|Indicates whether this workforce integration is currently active and available.|
|supports|string| Possible values are `none`, `shift`, `swapRequest`, `openshift`, `openShiftRequest`, `userShiftPreferences`. If selecting more than one value, all values must start with the first letter in uppercase.|

If selecting more than one value, all values must start with the first letter in uppercase.|
