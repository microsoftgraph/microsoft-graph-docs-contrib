# mailbox: exportItems

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Export Exchange [mailboxItem](../resources/mailboxitem.md) objects in full fidelity. This API exports each item as an opaque stream. The data stream isn't intended for parsing, but can be used to import an item back into an Exchange mailbox. For more information, see: [Overview of the mailbox import and export APIs in Microsoft Graph (preview)](/graph/mailbox-import-export-concept-overview)

You can export up to 20 items in a single export request.

[!INCLUDE [national-cloud-support](../../includes/global-only.md)]

## Permissions

Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](/graph/permissions-reference).
