### Example 2: Notify a user about an event using a custom topic

If you want to link an aspect that Microsoft Graph doesn't represent, or you want to customize the name, you can set the source of the `topic` to `text` and pass in a custom value for it. `webUrl` is required when using `topic` source as `text`.
