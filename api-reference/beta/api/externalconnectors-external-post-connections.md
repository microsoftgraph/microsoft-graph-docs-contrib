Namespace: microsoft.graph.externalConnectors

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Create a new [externalConnection](../resources/externalconnectors-externalconnection.md).

[!INCLUDE [national-cloud-support](../../includes/global-us.md)]

## Permissions

Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](/graph/permissions-reference).

## HTTP request

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->

```http
POST /external/connections
```

## Request headers

| Name          | Description                 |
|:--------------|:----------------------------|
|Authorization|Bearer {token}. Required. Learn more about [authentication and authorization](/graph/auth/auth-concepts).|
| Content-Type  | application/json. Required. |

## Request body

In the request body, supply a JSON representation of an [externalConnection](../resources/externalconnectors-externalconnection.md) object.

## Response

If successful, this method returns `201 Created` response code and a new [externalConnection](../resources/externalconnectors-externalconnection.md) object in the response body.

>**Note:** When you create an external connection with a broken adaptive card for the result layout, the first call will fail with a `503 Service Unavailable`. When you try the call again, the second call will fail with a `409 Conflict` response that states that a connection with the same name already exists. This happens because the connection was created even though the first call failed with `503 Service Unavailable`. For more details, see [Known issues](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/known-issues/?search=19908).
