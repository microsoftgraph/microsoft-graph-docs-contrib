# List passwordMethods

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Retrieve a list of [password authentication method](../resources/passwordauthenticationmethod.md) objects. This API returns exactly one object referenced by ID `28c10230-6103-485e-b985-444c60001490`, as a user can have exactly one password. For security, the password itself is never returned in the object and the **password** property is always `null`.

[!INCLUDE [national-cloud-support](../../includes/all-clouds.md)]

## Permissions

Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](/graph/permissions-reference).
