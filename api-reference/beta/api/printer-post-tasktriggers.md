# Create taskTrigger

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Create a new [task trigger](../resources/printtasktrigger.md) on the specified [printer](../resources/printer.md). Currently, only **one** task trigger can be specified per printer, but this limit might be removed in the future. 

>**Note:** The appId used to generate an access token for creating a task trigger should be the same appId that was used to create the corresponding task definition.
