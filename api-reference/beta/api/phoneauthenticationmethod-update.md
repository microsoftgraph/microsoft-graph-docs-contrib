# Update phoneAuthenticationMethod

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Update the phone number associated with a [phone authentication method](../resources/phoneauthenticationmethod.md).

You can't change a phone's type. To change a phone's type, add a new number of the desired type and then delete the object with the original type.

If a user is enabled by policy to use SMS to sign in and the `mobile` number is changed, the system will attempt to register the number for use in that system.

## Permissions

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

### Permissions acting on self

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:---------------------------------------|:-------------------------|
| Delegated (work or school account)     | UserAuthenticationMethod.ReadWrite |
| Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported. |
| Application                            | Not supported. |

### Permissions acting on other users

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:---------------------------------------|:-------------------------|
| Delegated (work or school account)     | UserAuthenticationMethod.ReadWrite.All |
| Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported. |
| Application                            | UserAuthenticationMethod.ReadWrite.All |

For delegated scenarios where an admin is acting on another user, the admin needs [one of the following roles](/azure/active-directory/users-groups-roles/directory-assign-admin-roles#available-roles):
* Global admin
* Privileged authentication admin
* Authentication admin
