# Unarchive team

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Restore an archived [team](../resources/team.md) and restores users' ability to send messages and edit the team, abiding by tenant and team settings. Teams are archived using the [archive](team-archive.md) API.

Unarchiving is an async operation. A team is unarchived once the async operation completes successfully, which might occur subsequent to a response from this API.

[!INCLUDE [national-cloud-support](../../includes/all-clouds.md)]

## Permissions
Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](/graph/permissions-reference).

This API supports admin permissions. Microsoft Teams service admins can access teams that they aren't a member of.

> - The TeamSettings.ReadWrite.Group permission uses [resource-specific consent](/microsoftteams/platform/graph-api/rsc/resource-specific-consent).
> - The Group.ReadWrite.All and Directory.ReadWrite.All permissions are supported only for backward compatibility. We recommend that you update your solutions to use an alternative permission listed in the previous table and avoid using these permissions going forward.
