# Unarchive team

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Restore an archived [team](../resources/team.md). This restores users' ability to send messages and edit the team, abiding by tenant and team settings. Teams are archived using the [archive](team-archive.md) API.

Unarchiving is an async operation. A team is unarchived once the async operation completes successfully, which may occur subsequent to a response from this API.
