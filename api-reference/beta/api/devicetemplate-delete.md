# Delete deviceTemplate

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Delete a registered [deviceTemplate](../resources/devicetemplate.md). You must first [delete](../api/device-delete.md) all devices linked to the template before deleting the template itself. Only [registered owners](../api/devicetemplate-list-owners.md) of the template can perform this operation.

[!INCLUDE [national-cloud-support](../../includes/global-only.md)]

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `204 No Content` response code. It doesn't return anything in the response body. Device templates can't be deleted until all linked devices are removed; otherwise, this method returns a `400 Bad Request` response code. If the caller isn't the owner of the device template, this method returns a `403 Forbidden` response code that indicates that the caller isn't authorized to delete this template.
