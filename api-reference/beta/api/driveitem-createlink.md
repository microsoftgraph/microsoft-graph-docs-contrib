# driveItem: createLink

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

You can use **createLink** action to share a [driveItem](../resources/driveitem.md) via a sharing link.

The **createLink** action will create a new sharing link if the specified link type doesn't already exist for the calling application.
If a sharing link of the specified type already exists for the app, the existing sharing link will be returned.

DriveItem resources inherit sharing permissions from their ancestors.

## Permissions

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) | Files.ReadWrite, Files.ReadWrite.All, Sites.ReadWrite.All    |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Files.ReadWrite, Files.ReadWrite.All    |
|Application | Files.ReadWrite.All, Sites.ReadWrite.All |

| retainInheritedPermissions |  Boolean          | Optional. If `true` (default), any existing inherited permissions are retained on the shared item when sharing this item for the first time. If `false`, all existing permissions are removed when sharing for the first time.  |
|sendNotification|Boolean|If `true`, this method sends a [sharing link](../resources/permission.md#sharing-links) in an email to users specified in `recipients`. Applicable to OneDrive for Business or SharePoint. The default value is `false`. Optional.|

### Link types

The following values are allowed for the **type** parameter.

| Type value | Description                                                                                  |

The following values are allowed for the **scope** parameter.

| users        | Specific people in the recipient's collection can use the link to get access. Only available in OneDrive for Business and SharePoint.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a single [Permission](../resources/permission.md) resource in the response body that represents the requested sharing permissions.

The response will be `201 Created` if a new sharing link is created for the **driveItem** or `200 OK` if an existing link is returned.

## Examples

### Example 1: Create an anonymous sharing link
The following example requests a sharing link to be created for the **driveItem** specified by {itemId} in the user's OneDrive.
The sharing link is configured to be read-only and usable by anyone with the link.
For OneDrive for Business and SharePoint users, use the `sendNotification` parameter to create a sharing link. The sharing link is then sent to recipients via email.
All existing permissions are removed when sharing for the first time if `retainInheritedPermissions` is false.

### Example 2: Creating company sharable links

OneDrive for Business and SharePoint support company sharable links.
These are similar to anonymous links, except they only work for members of the owning organization.
To create a company sharable link, use the **scope** parameter with a value of `organization`.

### Example 3: Creating embeddable links

When using the `embed` link type, the webUrl returned can be embedded in an `<iframe>` HTML element.

>**Note:** Embed links are only supported for OneDrive personal.

## Remarks

* To create a link based on the organization's default policy and the caller's permissions on the **driveItem**, omit the scope and type parameters
* Links created using this action do not expire unless a default expiration policy is enforced for the organization.
* Links are visible in the sharing permissions for the **driveItem** and can be removed by an owner of the **driveItem**.
* Links always point to the current version of a **driveItem** unless the **driveItem** is checked out (SharePoint only).
