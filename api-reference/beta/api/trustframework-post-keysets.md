# Create trustFrameworkKeySet

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Create a new [trustFrameworkKeySet](../resources/trustframeworkkeyset.md). The ID of the **trustFrameworkKeySet** is expected in the create request; however, it can be modified by the service. The modified ID will be available in the response and in the location header.

## Permissions

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

| Permission type                        | Permissions (from least to most privileged) |
|:---------------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------|
| Delegated (work or school account)     | TrustFrameworkKeySet.ReadWrite.All	|
| Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported. |
| Application                            | TrustFrameworkKeySet.ReadWrite.All	 |

## HTTP request

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->

```http
POST /trustFramework/keySets
```

## Request headers

| Name          | Description   |
|:--------------|:--------------|
| Authorization | Bearer {token}. Required. |
|Content-type | application/json. Required. |

## Request body

In the request body, supply a JSON representation of a [trustFrameworkKeySet](../resources/trustframeworkkeyset.md) object.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `201 Created` response code, a location header for the newly created object, and a new [trustFrameworkKeySet](../resources/trustframeworkkeyset.md) object in the response body.

## Examples

### Example 1: Create an empty keyset
This is one of the most useful operations. First, you create an empty keyset. Then, in the new keyset, you can generate a key, upload a manual secret, and upload a certificate or a PKCS12 key.

```http
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Content-type: application/json
Location: /trustFramework/keySets('B2C_1A_keyset1')

{

```

### Example 2: Create a keyset with a key

This is an advanced scenario where you need to know the [RFC 7517](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7517#section-5) compliant JSON Web Key format of the key.
