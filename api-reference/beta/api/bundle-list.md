#### Request


# [HTTP](#tab/http)
<!-- { "blockType": "request", "name": "list-all-bundles", "tags": "service.onedrive" } -->

```msgraph-interactive
GET https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/drive/bundles
```

### Example 2: List all photo albums in a drive

To filter the list of bundles returned from a request to the bundles collection, you can use the `filter` query string parameter to specify the type of bundle to return by checking for the existence of a facet on the bundle:

#### Request


# [HTTP](#tab/http)
<!-- {"blockType": "request", "name": "list-album-bundles", "tags": "service.onedrive" } -->

```msgraph-interactive
GET https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/drive/bundles?filter=bundle/album%20ne%20null
```

#### Response

The response to a GET to the bundles endpoint is an array of [driveItem][] resources with the [bundle][].
Because all bundles are items, you can use use all the standard item operations on them.

<!-- { "blockType": "response", "@odata.type": "microsoft.graph.driveItem", "truncated": true, "isCollection": true } -->

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK

    {
      "id": "0123456789abc",
