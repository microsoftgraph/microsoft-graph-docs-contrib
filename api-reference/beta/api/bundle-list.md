#### Response

The following example shows the response.

> **Note**: The response object shown here might be shortened for readability.

<!-- { "blockType": "response", "@odata.type": "microsoft.graph.driveItem", "truncated": true, "isCollection": true } -->

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-type: application/json

{
  "value": [
    {
      "id": "0123456789abc",
      "name": "Vacation photo album",

}
```


### Example 2: List all photo albums in a drive

To filter the list of bundles returned from a request to the bundles collection, you can use the `filter` query string parameter to specify the type of bundle to return by checking for the existence of a facet on the bundle.

#### Request

The following example shows a request.

# [HTTP](#tab/http)
<!-- {"blockType": "request", "name": "list-album-bundles-e2", "tags": "service.onedrive" } -->

```msgraph-interactive
GET https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/drive/bundles?filter=bundle/album%20ne%20null

#### Response

The following example shows the response. The response to a GET to the bundles endpoint is an array of [driveItem][] resources with the [bundle][].
Because all bundles are items, you can use all the standard item operations on them.
