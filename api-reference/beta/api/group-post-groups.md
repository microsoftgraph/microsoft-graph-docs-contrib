# Create group

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Create a new [group](../resources/group.md) as specified in the request body. You can create one of the following groups:

- Microsoft 365 group (unified group)
- Security group

This operation returns by default only a subset of the properties for each group. These default properties are noted in the [Properties](../resources/group.md#properties) section. To get properties that are _not_ returned by default, do a [GET operation](group-get.md) and specify the properties in a `$select` OData query option.

**Note**: To create a [team](../resources/team.md), first create a group then add a team to it, see [create team](../api/team-put-teams.md).

[!INCLUDE [national-cloud-support](../../includes/all-clouds.md)]

## Permissions

Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](/graph/permissions-reference).

<!-- { "blockType": "permissions", "name": "group_post_groups" } -->
[!INCLUDE [permissions-table](../includes/permissions/group-post-groups-permissions.md)]

For an app create a group with owners or members while it has the *Group.Create* permission, the app must have the privileges to read the object type that it wants to assign as the group owner or member. Therefore:
+ The app can assign itself as the group's owner or member.
+ To create the group with users as owners or members, the app must have at least the *User.Read.All* permission.
+ To create the group with other service principals as owners or members, the app must have at least the *Application.Read.All* permission.
+ To create the group with either users or service principals as owners or members, the app must have at least the *Directory.Read.All* permission.

## HTTP request

| :-------------- | :------ | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| displayName     | string  | The name to display in the address book for the group. Maximum length is 256 characters. Required.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| mailEnabled     | Boolean | Set to `true` for mail-enabled groups. Required.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

Required. |
| securityEnabled | Boolean | Set to `true` for security-enabled groups, including Microsoft 365 groups. Required. **Note:** Groups created using the Microsoft Entra admin center or the Azure portal always have **securityEnabled** initially set to `true`.                                                                                                                                    |

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> - Creating a group using the **Group.Create** application permission without specifying owners creates the group anonymously and the group isn't modifiable. Add owners to the group while creating it so the owners can manage the group.
>
> - Creating a Microsoft 365 group in an app-only context and without specifying owners creates the group anonymously. Doing so can result in the associated SharePoint Online site not being created automatically until further manual action is taken.
> 
> - Creating a Microsoft 365 or security group in a delegated context, signed in as a non-admin user, and without specifying owners automatically adds the calling user as the group owner. An admin user is automatically added as the group owner of a Microsoft 365 group they create but not of a security group.
>
> - A non-admin user can't add themselves to the group owners collection. For more information, see the related [known issue](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/known-issues/?search=26419).
>
> - To following properties can't be set in the initial POST request and must be set in a subsequent PATCH request: **allowExternalSenders**, **autoSubscribeNewMembers**, **hideFromAddressLists**, **hideFromOutlookClients**, **isSubscribedByMail**, **unseenCount**.

Because the **group** resource supports [extensions](/graph/extensibility-overview), you can add custom properties with your own data to the group while creating it.

### groupTypes options

Use the **groupTypes** property to control the type of group and its membership, as shown.

| Type of group                     | Assigned membership | Dynamic membership                |
| :-------------------------------- | :------------------ | :-------------------------------- |
| Microsoft 365 (aka unified group) | `["Unified"]`       | `["Unified","DynamicMembership"]` |
| Dynamic                           | `[]` (_null_)       | `["DynamicMembership"]`           |

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `201 Created` response code and a [group](../resources/group.md) object in the response body. The response includes only the default properties of the group.

## Examples

### Example 1: Create a Microsoft 365 group

The following example creates a Microsoft 365 group. Because the owners have not been specified, the calling user is automatically added as the owner of the group.

### Example 2: Create a security group with an owner and members

The following example creates a security group with an owner and members specified. Note that a maximum of 20 relationships, such as owners and members, can be added as part of group creation. You can subsequently add more members by using the [add member](/graph/api/group-post-members?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) API or JSON batching.

A non-admin user can't add themselves to the group owners collection. For more information, see the related [known issue](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/known-issues/?search=26419).

### Example 3: Create a Microsoft 365 group that can be assigned to a Microsoft Entra role

#### Request

The following example shows a request. The calling user must be assigned the _RoleManagement.ReadWrite.Directory_ permission to set the **isAssignableToRole** property or update the membership of such groups.

A group with **isAssignableToRole** property set to `true` cannot be of dynamic membership type, its **securityEnabled** must be set to `true`, and **visibility** can only be `Private`.
