# permission: grant

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Grant users access to a link represented by a [permission][].

[!INCLUDE [national-cloud-support](../../includes/all-clouds.md)]

## Permissions

Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](/graph/permissions-reference).

<!-- { "blockType": "permissions", "name": "permission_grant" } -->
[!INCLUDE [permissions-table](../includes/permissions/permission-grant-permissions.md)]

## HTTP request

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->

```http
POST /shares/{encoded-sharing-url}/permission/grant
```

## Request headers

| Name          | Description  |
|:------------- |:------------ |
|Authorization|Bearer {token}. Required. Learn more about [authentication and authorization](/graph/auth/auth-concepts).|

## Request body

In the request body, provide a JSON object with the following parameters.

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored", "scopes": "files.readwrite" } -->

```json
{
  "recipients": [
    { "@odata.type": "microsoft.graph.driveRecipient" }
  ],
  "roles": [ "read | write"]
}
```

| Parameter          | Type                           | Description
|:-------------------|:-------------------------------|:-------------------------
| recipients         | Collection([driveRecipient][]) | A collection of recipients who will receive access.
| roles              | Collection(String)             | If the link is an "existing access" link, specifies roles to be granted to the users. Otherwise must match the role of the link.

For a list of available roles, see [roles property values](../resources/permission.md#roles-property-values).

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and a [permission][] collection in the response body.

A [permission][] representing the updated link will always be returned in the result set on success. The updated link can be identified by the presence of a 'link' facet containing the 'scope' property. In some cases it may be possible that the updated link has a different URL than the original link, in which case the new URL should be used.

Read the [Error Responses][error-response] topic for more info about how errors are returned.


## Example

This example grants the users john@contoso.com and ryan@external.com access to a sharing link without modifying other existing permissions on the link.

### Response

<!-- { "blockType": "response", "@odata.type": "Collection(microsoft.graph.permission)", "truncated": true } -->

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-type: application/json

{
  "value": [
    {
      "hasPassword": false,
      "id": "5fab944a-47ec-48d0-a9b5-5178a926d00f",
      "link": {

      },
      "roles": [
        "read"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

>**Note:** The response object shown here might be shortened for readability.

If the link is an [existing access](../resources/permission.md#existing-access-link) link, additional permissions will be returned representing the following:

- User-type permissions representing recipients who were successfully granted access. These can be identified by presence of the **grantedTo** property.
- Link-type permissions representing invitations that need to be sent to unrecognized external users for them to gain access. These can be identified by the presence of an [invitation](../resources/sharinginvitation.md) facet. These entries will contain a [link][sharing-link] with the invitation URL, and the grantedToIdentities collection will indicate the users to whom the link should be sent.
