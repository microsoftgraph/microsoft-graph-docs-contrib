# Create virtualAppointment (deprecated)
Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

> [!CAUTION]
> The **virtualAppointment** resource and supporting methods are deprecated and will stop returning data on June 30, 2023. We recommend that you update existing apps that use this API to use the new [Get join link](../api/virtualappointment-getvirtualappointmentjoinweburl.md) function.

Create a new [virtualAppointment](../resources/virtualappointment.md) object.

## Permissions
Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](/graph/permissions-reference).

[!INCLUDE [permissions-table](../includes/permissions/virtualappointment-put-permissions.md)]

> [!NOTE]
> Virtual appointment will transition from online meeting permissions to more specific virtual appointment permissions during the preview period. This will give developers more granular control over virtual appointment permissions. We'll provide additional details on when online meeting permissions will no longer be supported before the preview period ends.
