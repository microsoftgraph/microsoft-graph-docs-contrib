# event: permanentDelete

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Permanently delete an event and place it in the Purges folder in the dumpster in the user's mailbox. Email clients such as Outlook or the Outlook on the web can't access permanently deleted items. Unless there's a hold set on the mailbox, the items are permanently deleted after a set period of time.

For more information about item retention, see [Configure Deleted Item retention and Recoverable Items quotas](/exchange/configure-deleted-item-retention-and-recoverable-items-quotas-exchange-2013-help).

>**Note:** Folders aren't placed in the Purges folder when they are permanently deleted. Permanently deleted folders are removed from the mailbox.
