# newsLinkPage: publish

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Publish the latest version of a [newsLinkPage](../resources/newslinkpage.md) resource that makes the version available to all users. If the page is checked out, check it in first and then publish it. If the page is checked out to the caller of this API, it is automatically checked in and then published. If content approval is activated in the page library, the page isn't published until the approval flow is completed.

## Permissions

Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types).
