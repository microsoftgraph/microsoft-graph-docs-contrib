# Add deviceTemplate owner

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Add a new owner to a [deviceTemplate](../resources/devicetemplate.md) object. Owners are granted permissions to enable or disable devices and update properties, such as **alternativeNames**, for the devices created from the device template. As an owner, no other administrator roles are necessary to create, update, or delete devices from this template, as well as to add or remove template owners. Owners added via this API are returned in a [list device owners](../api/devicetemplate-list-owners.md) request. There can be a maximum of 100 owners on a device template.

## Permissions

Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](/graph/permissions-reference).
