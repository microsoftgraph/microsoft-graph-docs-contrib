## HTTP request

<!-- {
  "blockType": "ignored"
}
-->
``` http
GET /teams/{team-id}/incomingChannels
```

## Optional query parameters
This method supports the `$filter` and `$select` [OData query parameters](/graph/query-parameters) to help customize the response.

## Request headers
|Name|Description|
|:---|:---|
|Authorization|Bearer {token}. Required. Learn more about [authentication and authorization](/graph/auth/auth-concepts).|

## Request body
Don't supply a request body for this method.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and a collection of [channel](../resources/channel.md) objects in the response body. The response also includes the **@odata.id** property which can be used to access the channel and run other operations on the [channel](../resources/channel.md) object.

> [!Note]
> Currently, invoking the URL returned from the **@odata.id** property fails for cross-tenant shared channels. You can solve this issue if you remove the `/tenants/{tenant-id}` part from the URL before you call this API. For more details, see [Known issues with Microsoft Graph](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/known-issues/?search=14971).
