# List places

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Get a collection of the specified type of [place](../resources/place.md) objects defined in the tenant. For example, you can get all the rooms, all the room lists, or the rooms in a specific room list in the tenant.

A **place** object can be one of the following types:

* A [room](../resources/room.md) which includes rich properties such as an email address for the room, and accessibility, capacity, and device support. 
* A [room list](../resources/roomlist.md) which includes an email address for the room list, and a navigation property to get the collection of room instances in the room list. 

Both **room** and **roomList** are derived from the **place** object.

By default, this operation returns 100 places per page. 

Compared with the [findRooms](../api/user-findrooms.md) and [findRoomLists](../api/user-findroomlists.md) functions, this operation returns a richer payload for rooms and room lists. See [details](../resources/place.md#using-the-places-api) for how they compare.

## Permissions
