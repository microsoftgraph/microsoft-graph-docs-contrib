# Grant an appRoleAssignment to a user

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Use this API to assign an [app role](../resources/approle.md) to a [user](../resources/user.md), creating an [appRoleAssignment](../resources/approleassignment.md) object. To grant an app role assignment to a user, you need three identifiers:

- `principalId`: The `id` of the user to whom you are assigning the app role.
- `resourceId`: The `id` of the resource `servicePrincipal` that has defined the app role.
- `appRoleId`: The `id` of the `appRole` (defined on the resource service principal) to assign to the user.

[!INCLUDE [national-cloud-support](../../includes/all-clouds.md)]

## Permissions

Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](/graph/permissions-reference).

## HTTP request

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
POST /users/{id | userPrincipalName}/appRoleAssignments
```

> [!NOTE]
> As a best practice, we recommend creating app role assignments through the `appRoleAssignedTo` relationship of the _resource_ service principal, instead of the `appRoleAssignments` relationship of the assigned user, group, or service principal.

## Request headers

| Name       | Description|
|:-----------|:----------|
|Authorization|Bearer {token}. Required. Learn more about [authentication and authorization](/graph/auth/auth-concepts).|
| Content-Type | application/json. Required. |

## Request body

In the request body, supply a JSON representation of an [appRoleAssignment](../resources/approleassignment.md) object.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `201 Created` response code and an [appRoleAssignment](../resources/approleassignment.md) object in the response body.
