# Archive team

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Archive the specified [team](../resources/team.md). 
When a team is archived, users can no longer make most changes to the team. For example, users can no longer: send or like messages on any channel in the team; edit the team's name or description; nor edit other settings. However, membership changes to the team continue to be allowed.

Archiving is an async operation. A team is archived once the async operation completes successfully, which can occur subsequent to a response from this API.

To archive a team, the team and [group](../resources/group.md) must have an owner.

To restore a team from its archived state, use the API to [unarchive](team-unarchive.md).

[!INCLUDE [national-cloud-support](../../includes/all-clouds.md)]

## Permissions
Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](/graph/permissions-reference).

This API supports admin permissions. Microsoft Teams service admins can access teams that they aren't a member of.

[!INCLUDE [permissions-table](../includes/permissions/team-archive-permissions.md)]

> [!NOTE]
> - The TeamSettings.ReadWrite.Group permission uses [resource-specific consent](/microsoftteams/platform/graph-api/rsc/resource-specific-consent).
> - The Group.ReadWrite.All and Directory.ReadWrite.All permissions are supported only for backward compatibility. We recommend that you update your solutions to use an alternative permission listed in the previous table and avoid using these permissions going forward.

## HTTP request
<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
POST /teams/{id}/archive
```
## Request headers
| Header       | Value |
|:---------------|:--------|
|Authorization|Bearer {token}. Required. Learn more about [authentication and authorization](/graph/auth/auth-concepts).|

## Request body
In the request, you can _optionally_ include the `shouldSetSpoSiteReadOnlyForMembers` parameter in a JSON body, as follows.
```JSON
{
    "shouldSetSpoSiteReadOnlyForMembers": true
}
```
This optional parameter defines whether to set permissions for team members to read-only on the SharePoint Online site associated with the team. Setting it to false or omitting the body altogether results in this step being skipped.

## Response

If archiving is started successfully, this method returns a `202 Accepted` response code. The response also contains a `Location` header, which contains the location of the [teamsAsyncOperation](../resources/teamsasyncoperation.md) that was created to handle archiving of the team. Check the status of the archiving operation by making a GET request to this location.
