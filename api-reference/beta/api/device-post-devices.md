## Permissions
Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](/graph/permissions-reference).


<!-- { "blockType": "permissions", "name": "device_post_devices" } -->
[!INCLUDE [permissions-table](../includes/permissions/device-post-devices-permissions.md)]

The calling user must also be in one of the following [Microsoft Entra roles](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference?toc=%2Fgraph%2Ftoc.json): *Global Administrator*, *Intune Administrator*, or *Windows 365 Administrator*.

## HTTP request
<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
POST /devices

```
## Request headers
| Name       | Description|
|:---------------|:--------|
|Authorization|Bearer {token}. Required. Learn more about [authentication and authorization](/graph/auth/auth-concepts).|

## Request body
In the request body, supply a JSON representation of [device](../resources/device.md) object.

Since the **device** resource supports [extensions](/graph/extensibility-overview), you can use the `POST` operation and add custom properties with your own data to the device instance while creating it.

## Response

If successful, this method returns `201 Created` response code and [device](../resources/device.md) object in the response body.
