## HTTP request
<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
POST /devices

```
## Request headers
| Name       | Description|
|:---------------|:--------|
|Authorization|Bearer {token}. Required. Learn more about [authentication and authorization](/graph/auth/auth-concepts).|

## Request body
In the request body, supply a JSON representation of [device](../resources/device.md) object.

Since the **device** resource supports [extensions](/graph/extensibility-overview), you can use the `POST` operation and add custom properties with your own data to the device instance while creating it.

## Response

If successful, this method returns `201 Created` response code and [device](../resources/device.md) object in the response body.
