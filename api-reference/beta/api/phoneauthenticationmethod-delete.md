# Delete phoneAuthenticationMethod

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Delete a user's [phone authentication method](../resources/phoneauthenticationmethod.md). 

>**Note:** This removes the phone number from the user and they will no longer be able to use the number for authentication, whether via SMS or voice calls.

Remember that a user cannot have an `alternateMobile` number without a `mobile` number. If you want to remove a `mobile` number from a user that also has an `alternateMobile` number, first [update](phoneauthenticationmethod-update.md) the `mobile` number to the new number, then delete the `alternateMobile` number.

If the phone number is the user's default Azure multi-factor authentication (MFA) authentication method, it cannot be deleted. Have the user change their default authentication method, and then delete the number.

## Permissions

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

### Permissions acting on self

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:---------------------------------------|:-------------------------|
| Delegated (work or school account)     | UserAuthenticationMethod.ReadWrite |
| Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported. |
| Application                            | Not supported. |

### Permissions acting on other users

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:---------------------------------------|:-------------------------|
| Delegated (work or school account)     | UserAuthenticationMethod.ReadWrite.All |
| Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported. |
| Application                            | UserAuthenticationMethod.ReadWrite.All |

For delegated scenarios where an admin is acting on another user, the admin needs [one of the following roles](/azure/active-directory/users-groups-roles/directory-assign-admin-roles#available-roles):
* Global admin
* Privileged authentication admin
* Authentication admin
