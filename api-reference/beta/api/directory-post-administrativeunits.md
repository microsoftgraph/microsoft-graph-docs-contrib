## Permissions
Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](/graph/permissions-reference).

## HTTP request
<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
POST /administrativeUnits
POST /directory/administrativeUnits
```

## Request headers
| Name      |Description|
|:----------|:----------|
|Authorization|Bearer {token}. Required. Learn more about [authentication and authorization](/graph/auth/auth-concepts).|
| Content-type | application/json. Required. |

## Request body
In the request body, supply a JSON representation of an [administrativeUnit](../resources/administrativeunit.md) object.

You can specify the following properties when you create an **administrativeUnit**.

| Property   | Type |Description|
|:---------------|:--------|:----------|
| description | String | Description for the administrative unit. Optional. |
| displayName | String | Display name for the administrative unit. Required. |
| isMemberManagementRestricted | Boolean | `true` if members of this administrative unit should be treated as sensitive, which requires specific permissions to manage. If not set, the default value is `null` and the default behavior is false. Use this property to define administrative units with roles that don't inherit from tenant-level administrators, and management of individual member objects is limited to administrators scoped to a restricted management administrative unit. This property is immutable and can't be changed later. Optional. |
| membershipRule | String | The dynamic membership rule for the administrative unit. For more information about the rules you can use for dynamic administrative units and dynamic groups, see [Manage rules for dynamic membership groups in Microsoft Entra ID](/entra/identity/users/groups-dynamic-membership). Optional.|
| membershipRuleProcessingState | String | Controls whether the dynamic membership rule is actively processed. Set to `On` to activate the dynamic membership rule, or `Paused` to stop updating membership dynamically. Optional. |
| membershipType | String | Indicates the membership type for the administrative unit. The possible values are: `dynamic`, `assigned`. If not set, the default value is `null` and the default behavior is assigned. Optional. |
| visibility | String | The visibility of the administrative unit. If not set, the default value is `null` and the default behavior is public. It can be set to `HiddenMembership` to hide the membership from nonmembers. Optional. |

The **administrativeUnit** resource supports [extensions](/graph/extensibility-overview), which allows you to use the `POST` operation to add custom properties with your own data when you create the administrative unit.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `201 Created` response code and an [administrativeUnit](../resources/administrativeunit.md) object in the response body.
