# educationSubmission: unsubmit

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Indicate that a student wants to work on the submitted assignment after it was turned in. Only teachers, students, and applications with application permissions can perform this operation.

This method changes the status of the submission from `submitted` to `working`. During the submit process, all the resources are copied from **submittedResources** to  **workingResources**. The teacher will be looking at the working resources list for grading.

A teacher can also unsubmit a student's assignment on their behalf.
