# Get recent user activities

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Get recent activities for a given user. This OData function has some default behaviors included to make it operate like a "most recently used" API. The service queries for the most recent [activityHistoryItems](../resources/projectrome-historyitem.md), and then pull those related activities. Activities are sorted according to the most recent **lastModified** on the **activityHistoryItem**. This means that activities without **activityHistoryItems** won't be included in the response. The UserActivity.ReadWrite.CreatedByApp permission will also apply extra filtering to the response, so that only activities created by your application are returned. This server-side filtering might result in empty pages if the user is active and other applications have created more recent activities. To get your application's activities, use the **nextLink** property to paginate.

## Permissions

Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](/graph/permissions-reference).

## HTTP request

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->

```http
GET /me/activities/recent
```

## Optional query parameters

This method supports some [OData Query Parameters](/graph/query-parameters) to help customize the response. The following query parameters are supported:

- $expand for the **historyItems** navigation property.
- $top to limit the maximum number of items across pages.
- $filter on the **lastModifiedDateTime** property for either **activities** or **historyItems**, if expanded.

The following are some examples of supported queries with URL encoding.

```http
/me/activities/recent?$expand=historyItems($filter=lastModifiedDateTime%20gt%202018-01-22T21:45:00.347Z%20and%20lastModifiedDateTime%20lt%202018-01-22T22:00:00.347Z)

/me/activities/recent?$filter=lastModifiedDateTime%20lt%202018-01-16T01:03:21.347Z%20and%20lastModifiedDateTime%20gt%202018-01-03T01:03:21.347Z
