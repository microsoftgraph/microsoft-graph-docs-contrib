# Get authentication operation

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Retrieve the properties and relationships of an [operation](../resources/operation.md) object. Currently these operations are generated by initiating a password reset using the [reset password](authenticationmethod-resetpassword.md) method. An operation object tells the caller about the current state of that password reset operation. Possible states include:

* NotStarted
* Running
* Succeeded
* Failed

`Succeeded` and `Failed` are terminal states.
