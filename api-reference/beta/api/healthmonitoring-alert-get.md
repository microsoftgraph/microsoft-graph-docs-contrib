# Get alert

Namespace: microsoft.graph.healthMonitoring

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Read the properties and relationships of a Microsoft Entra health monitoring [alert](../resources/healthmonitoring-alert.md) object. The returned alert object contains information about the state, type, date, and impact of each alert that fired within your tenant.

[!INCLUDE [national-cloud-support](../../includes/global-only.md)]

## Permissions

Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](/graph/permissions-reference).

[!INCLUDE [rbac-healthmonitoring-alert-apis-read](../includes/rbac-for-apis/rbac-healthmonitoring-alert-apis-read.md)]

## HTTP request

<!-- {
  "blockType": "ignored"
}
-->
``` http
GET /reports/healthMonitoring/alerts/{alertId}
```

## Optional query parameters

This method supports the `$select` and `$expand` [OData query parameters](/graph/query-parameters) to help customize the response.

When no `$expand` query parameter is added, this API doesn't return `resourceSampling` property by default. When you want to retrieve a sample of the resources involved in triggering the alert for root cause investigation, you can add `$expand=enrichment/impacts/microsoft.graph.healthmonitoring.directoryobjectimpactsummary/resourceSampling` to view `resourceSampling` in [directoryObjectImpactSummary](../resources//healthmonitoring-directoryobjectimpactsummary.md).

## Request headers

|Name|Description|
|:---|:---|
|Authorization|Bearer {token}. Required. Learn more about [authentication and authorization](/graph/auth/auth-concepts).|
|Prefer: include-unknown-enum-members | Enables evolvable enum values beyond the sentinel value. For more information, see [Best practices for working with Microsoft Graph](/graph/best-practices-concept#handling-future-members-in-evolvable-enumerations). Optional. |

## Request body

Don't supply a request body for this method.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and a [microsoft.graph.healthMonitoring.alert](../resources/healthmonitoring-alert.md) object in the response body.
