# Create qrCodePinAuthenticationMethod

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Create a new [qrCodePinAuthenticationMethod](../resources/qrcodepinauthenticationmethod.md) object for the user. A user can have only one active QR code authentication method. A new QR code authentication can be added if an existing one expires or is deleted and is therefore unusable for sign-in. This auth method can have standard and temporary QR codes. An active QR code authentication method can have only one active standard and one temporary QR code. To create a new QR code authentication method, standard QR code, or temporary QR code, you must first [delete existing respective objects](../api/qrcode-delete.md).


## Permissions
Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](/graph/permissions-reference).

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
``` http
PUT /me/authentication/qrCodePinMethod
```

[!INCLUDE [me-apis-sign-in-note](../includes/me-apis-sign-in-note.md)]

Create another user's QR Code + PIN authentication method.
<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
``` http
PUT /users/{id}/authentication/qrCodePinMethod
```

## Request headers

|Name|Description|
|:---|:---|
|Authorization|Bearer {token}. Required. Learn more about [authentication and authorization](/graph/auth/auth-concepts).|
|Content-Type|application/json. Required.|

## Request body

In the request body, supply a JSON representation of the [qrCodePinAuthenticationMethod](../resources/qrcodepinauthenticationmethod.md) object.

You can specify the following properties when creating a **qrCodePinAuthenticationMethod**.

|Property|Type|Description|
|:---|:---|:---|
|standardQRCode|[qrCode](../resources/qrcode.md)|Standard QR code is primary QR code of the user with lifetime upto 395 days (13 months). There can be only one active standard QR code for the user. A new standard QR code can be created if an existing one is expired or deleted. The **startDateTime**, when this QR code is activated, and **expireDateTime**, when this QR code is expired, are required.|
|pin|[qrPin](../resources/qrpin.md)|The PIN linked to the QR Code for the user. The admin creates the temporary pin, which the user must change during sign-in. The admin can specify a custom or autogenerated PIN. Custom PIN support is only available during QR code creation only. |

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `201 Created` response code and a [qrCodePinAuthenticationMethod](../resources/qrcodepinauthenticationmethod.md) object in the response body.
