## Examples

### Example - delegated permissions

Here is an example of a minimal request. By omitting other properties, the client is implicitly taking defaults from the pre-defined template represented by `template`.

#### Request

```http
POST https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/teams
Content-Type: application/json
{
  "template@odata.bind": "https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/teamsTemplates/standard",
  "displayName": "My Sample Team",
  "description": "My Sample Team’s Description",
}
```

##### Response

```http
HTTP/1.1 202 Accepted
Content-Type: application/json
Location: /teams/{teamId}/operations/{operationId}
Content-Location: /teams/{teamId}
{
}
```

### Example - create a team with an app installed, multiple channels with pinned tabs using delegated permissions

Here is request with a full payload. The client can override values in the base template and add to array-valued items to the extent allowed by validation rules for the `specialization`.

#### Request

```http

### Example - application permissions

Here is an example of a minimal request using application permissions. By omitting other properties, the client is implicitly taking defaults from the pre-defined template represented by `template`. When issuing a request with application permissions a [user](../resources/user.md) must be specified in the `owners` collection.

#### Request

```http
POST https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/teams
Content-Type: application/json
{
  "template@odata.bind": "https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/teamsTemplates/standard",
  "displayName": "My Sample Team",
  "description": "My Sample Team’s Description",
  "owners@odata.bind": [
    "https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/users('abc123')"
  ]
}
```

#### Response

```http
HTTP/1.1 202 Accepted
Content-Type: application/json
Location: /teams/{teamId}/operations/{operationId}
Content-Location: /teams/{teamId}
{
}
```
