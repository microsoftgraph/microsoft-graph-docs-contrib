# Create team

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Create a new [team](../resources/team.md).

## Permissions

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

| Permission type                        | Permissions (from least to most privileged) |
| :------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------ |
| Delegated (work or school account)     | Team.Create, Group.ReadWrite.All**, Directory.ReadWrite.All** |
| Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported.                              |
| Application                            | Team.Create, Teamwork.Migrate.All, Group.ReadWrite.All**, Directory.ReadWrite.All** |

> **Note**: The Teamwork.Migrate.All permission is *only* supported for [migration](/microsoftteams/platform/graph-api/import-messages/import-external-messages-to-teams).
In the future, Microsoft may require you or your customers to pay additional fees based on the amount of data imported.

> **Note**: Permissions marked with ** are supported only for backward compatibility. We recommend that you update your solutions to use an alternative permission listed in the previous table and avoid using these permissions going forward.

## HTTP request

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->

```http
POST /teams
```

## Request headers

| Header        | Value                     |
| :------------ | :------------------------ |
| Authorization | Bearer {token}. Required. |
| Content-Type  | application/json. Required. |

## Request body

In the request body, supply a JSON representation of a [team](../resources/team.md) object.

## Response

If successful, this API returns a `202 Accepted` response that contains a link to the [teamsAsyncOperation](../resources/teamsasyncoperation.md).

## Examples

### Example 1: Delegated permissions

The following is an example of a minimal request. By omitting other properties, the client is implicitly taking defaults from the pre-defined template represented by `template`.

#### Request

### Example 2: Application permissions

The following is an example of a minimal request using application permissions. By omitting other properties, the client is implicitly taking defaults from the predefined template represented by `template`. When issuing a request with application permissions, a [user](../resources/user.md) must be specified in the `members` collection.

### Example 3: Create a team with multiple channels, installed apps, and pinned tabs using delegated permissions

The following is a request with a full payload. The client can override values in the base template and add to array-valued items to the extent allowed by validation rules for the `specialization`.

### Example 4: Create a team from group

The following example shows how you can create a new [team](../resources/team.md) from a [group](../resources/group.md), given a **groupId**.

A few things to note about this call:

* In order to create a team, the group you're creating it from must have a least one owner.
* The team that's created will always inherit from the group's display name, visibility, specialization, and members. Therefore, when making this call with the **group@odata.bind** property, the inclusion of team **displayName**, **visibility**, **specialization**, or **members@odata.bind** properties will return an error.
* If the group was created less than 15 minutes ago, it's possible for the Create team call to fail with a 404 error code due to replication delays. We recommend that you retry the Create team call three times, with a 10 second delay between calls.

### Example 5: Create a team from a group with multiple channels, installed apps, and pinned tabs

The following is a request that converts an existing group with extended properties which will create the team with multiple channels, installed apps, and pinned tabs.

### Example 6: Create a team with a non-standard base template type

Base template types are special templates that Microsoft created for specific industries. These base templates often contain proprietary apps that aren't available in the store and team properties that are not yet supported individually in Microsoft Teams templates.

To create a team from a non-standard base template, you’ll want to change the `template@odata.bind` property in the request body from `standard` to point to the specific base template you’d like to create.

To learn more about supported base template types, see [Get started with Teams templates](/MicrosoftTeams/get-started-with-teams-templates).

### Example 7: Create a team with a localized non-standard base template type 
Base template types can be localized to your preferred language choice, which enables you to create templates in your preferred language. 

Choose your team template from the defintion list returned by the [List definitions](/graph/api/teamtemplate-list-definitions) operation.

### Example 8: Create a team with a non-standard base template type with extended properties

Base template types can be extended with additional properties, enabling you to build on an existing base template with additional team settings, channels, apps, or tabs.

To learn more about supported base template types and supported properties, see [Get started with Teams templates](/MicrosoftTeams/get-started-with-teams-templates).

### Example 9: Create a team in migration mode

#### Request

The following example shows how to create a team for imported messages.

>**Note:** In the future, Microsoft may require you or your customers to pay additional fees based on the amount of data imported.

>**Note:** Teams created in migration mode only support the `standard` template.

Location: /teams('dbd8de4f-5d47-48da-87f1-594bed003375')/operations('3a6fdce1-c261-48bc-89de-1cfef658c0d5')
Content-Location: /teams('dbd8de4f-5d47-48da-87f1-594bed003375')
```

#### Error response

If the request is unsuccessful, this method returns a `400 Bad Request` response code.

```http
400 Bad Request
```

The following are common reasons for this response:

* **createdDateTime** is set in the future.
* **createdDateTime** is correctly specified but the **teamCreationMode** instance attribute is missing or set to an invalid value.

### Example 10: Application permissions using user principal name

The following is an example of a minimal request using application permissions. By omitting other properties, the client is implicitly taking defaults from the predefined template represented by `template`. When issuing a request with application permissions, a [user](../resources/user.md) must be specified in the `members` collection.
