# List allChannels
Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Get the list of [channels](../resources/channel.md) either in this [team](../resources/team.md) or shared with this [team](../resources/team.md) (incoming channels).

[!INCLUDE [national-cloud-support](../../includes/global-us.md)]

## Permissions
Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](/graph/permissions-reference).

<!-- { "blockType": "permissions", "name": "team_list_allchannels" } -->
[!INCLUDE [permissions-table](../includes/permissions/team-list-allchannels-permissions.md)]


> **Note**: This API supports admin permissions. Microsoft Teams service admins can access teams that they are not a member of.

## HTTP request

<!-- {
  "blockType": "ignored"
}
-->
```http
GET /teams/{team-id}/allChannels
```

## Optional query parameters
This method supports the `$filter` and `$select` [OData query parameters](/graph/query-parameters) to help customize the response.

### Use $select for better performance
Populating the **email** property for a channel is an expensive operation that results in slow performance. Use `$select` to exclude the **email** property to improve performance.

> **Note**: This API does not return the **moderationSettings** property for a channel by default. To get this property, use the `$select` query parameter.

## Request headers
|Name|Description|
|:---|:---|
|Authorization|Bearer {token}. Required. Learn more about [authentication and authorization](/graph/auth/auth-concepts).|

## Request body
Don't supply a request body for this method.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and a collection of [channel](../resources/channel.md) objects in the response body. The response also includes the **@odata.id** property, which can be used to access the channel and run other operations on the [channel](../resources/channel.md) object.

> [!Note]
> Currently, invoking the URL returned from the **@odata.id** property fails for cross-tenant shared channels. You can solve this issue if you remove the `/tenants/{tenant-id}` part from the URL before you call this API. For more information, see [Known issues with Microsoft Graph](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/known-issues/?search=14971).

> **Known Limitation**: In the current beta release, the **layoutType** property returns `null` when listing all channels. To get the layout type of a specific channel, use the [Get channel](../api/channel-get.md) API. Full support for **layoutType** in list operations is planned for a future release.
