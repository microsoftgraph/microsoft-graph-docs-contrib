# List allChannels
Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Get the list of [channels](../resources/channel.md) either in this [team](../resources/team.md) or shared with this [team](../resources/team.md) (incoming channels).

## Permissions
One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

|Permission type|Permissions (from least to most privileged)|
|:---|:---|
|Delegated (work or school account) | Channel.ReadBasic.All, ChannelSettings.Read.All, ChannelSettings.ReadWrite.All |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported.    |
|Application | Channel.ReadBasic.All, ChannelSettings.Read.All, ChannelSettings.ReadWrite.All |


> **Note**: This API supports admin permissions. Global admins and Microsoft Teams service admins can access teams that they are not a member of.

## HTTP request

<!-- {
  "blockType": "ignored"
}
-->
``` http
GET /teams/{team-id}/allChannels
```

## Optional query parameters
This method supports the `$filter` and `$select` [OData query parameters](/graph/query-parameters) to help customize the response.

### Use $select for better performance
Populating the **email** and **moderationSettings** properties for a channel is an expensive operation that results in slow performance. Use `$select` to exclude the **email** and **moderationSettings** properties to improve performance.

## Request headers
|Name|Description|
|:---|:---|
|Authorization|Bearer {token}. Required.|

## Request body
Do not supply a request body for this method.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and a collection of [channel](../resources/channel.md) objects in the response body. The response also includes the **@odata.id** property which can be used to access the channel and run other operations on the [channel](../resources/channel.md) object.

> [!Note]
> Currently, invoking the URL returned from the **@odata.id** property fails for cross-tenant shared channels. You can solve this issue if you remove the `/tenants/{tenant-id}` part from the URL before you call this API. For more details, see [Known issues with Microsoft Graph](/graph/known-issues#unable-to-access-a-cross-tenant-shared-channel-when-the-request-url-contains-tenantscross-tenant-id).
