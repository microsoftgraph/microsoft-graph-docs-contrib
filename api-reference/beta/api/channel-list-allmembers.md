# List allMembers

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Get a list of all [members](../resources/conversationmember.md) in a [channel](../resources/channel.md). It supports all types of channels. In the case of shared channels, it includes all cross-tenant and cross-team members in a channel.

> [!NOTE]
> The membership IDs returned by the server must be treated as opaque strings. Users shouldn't try to parse or make any assumptions about these resource IDs.

[!INCLUDE [national-cloud-support](../../includes/all-clouds.md)]

## Permissions

Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](/graph/permissions-reference).

> The `ChannelMember.Read.Group` and `ChannelMember.ReadWrite.Group` permissions use [resource-specific consent](/microsoftteams/platform/graph-api/rsc/resource-specific-consent). Currently, these permissions don't work for shared channels.

### Example 2: Find a channel member using their Microsoft Entra user object ID

The following example shows how to use the `$filter` query parameter to get a specific member of a channel using their Microsoft Entra [user](../resources/user.md) ID. This filter is applied on the **userId** property of the [aadUserConversationMember](../resources/aaduserconversationmember.md) resource.
