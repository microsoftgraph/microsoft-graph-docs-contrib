# conversationMember: add

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Add multiple members in a single request to a [team](../resources/team.md). The response provides details about which memberships could and couldn't be created.

> [!NOTE]
> Sometimes it takes time to reflect the addition of a member after they're added. Users can use [change notifications](../resources/change-notifications-api-overview.md) to subscribe to notifications for membership changes in a particular team.

[!INCLUDE [national-cloud-support](../../includes/all-clouds.md)]

## HTTP Request

This is a bound action to add multiple elements to a **conversationMember** collection in a single request.
<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->

```http
POST /teams/{team-id}/members/add
```

## Request headers

| Header        | Value                     |
| :------------ | :------------------------ |
|Authorization|Bearer {token}. Required. Learn more about [authentication and authorization](/graph/auth/auth-concepts).|

## Request body
In the request body, supply the JSON representation of the list of `conversationMember` derivatives that need to be added to the team. A maximum of 200 `conversationMember` derivatives can be added in one single request.

The following table shows the parameters that can be used with this action.

|Parameter|Type|Description|
|:---|:---|:---|
|values|[conversationMember](../resources/conversationmember.md) collection|List of conversation members that should be added.|


## Response

If successful, this action returns a `200 OK` response code and a collection of derivatives of [actionResultPart](../resources/actionresultpart.md) in the response body.

This API returns either a `200` response to indicate that all members supplied were added to the team, or a `207` response to indicate that only some of the supplied members were added to the team. The caller should inspect the response payload to determine which member additions failed. The response body is a collection of derivatives of the [actionResultPart](../resources/actionresultpart.md) resource. This API responds with an error when the request fails. For details about Microsoft Graph errors, see [Microsoft Graph errors and resource types](/graph/errors).
