# Update printershare

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Update the properties of a printer share. This method can be used to swap [printers](../resources/printer.md).

For example, if a physical printer device breaks, an administrator can register a new [printer](../resources/printer.md) device and update this [printerShare](../resources/printerShare.md) to point to the new printer without requiring users to take any action.

## Permissions
One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

|printer|microsoft.graph.printer|The printer that this printer share is related to. Use the `printer@odata.bind` syntax as shown in the following example to update which printer this printer share is associated with.|
