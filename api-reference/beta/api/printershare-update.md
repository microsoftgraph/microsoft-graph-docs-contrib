# Update printershare

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Update the properties of a printer share. This method can be used to swap [printers](../resources/printer.md).

For example, if a physical printer device breaks, an administrator can register a new [printer](../resources/printer.md) device and update this [printerShare](../resources/printerShare.md) to point to the new printer without requiring users to take any action.

| Content-type  | application/json. Required.|

## Request body
In the request body, supply the values for relevant [printerShare](../resources/printershare.md) fields to be updated.

|displayName|String|The name of the printer share that print clients should display.|
|allowAllUsers|Boolean|	If `true`, all users and groups are granted access to this printer share. This property supersedes the allow lists defined by the **allowedUsers** and **allowedGroups** navigation properties.|

> [!NOTE]
> If the **printer** property is updated, other properties can't be updated in the same request.

## Response
If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and an updated [printerShare](../resources/printershare.md) object in the response body.
