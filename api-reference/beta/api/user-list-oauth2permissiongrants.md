# List oauth2PermissionGrants

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Retrieve a list of [oAuth2PermissionGrant](../resources/oAuth2PermissionGrant.md) entities, which represent delegated permissions granted to enable a client application to access an API on behalf of the user.

> [!NOTE]
> This request might have replication delays for delegated permission grants that were recently created, updated, or deleted.
