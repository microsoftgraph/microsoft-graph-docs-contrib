# driveItem: permanentDelete

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Permanently delete a [driveItem](../resources/driveitem.md) by using its ID. If you delete items using this method, they're permanently removed and aren't sent to the recycle bin, unlike the [Delete driveItem](../api/driveitem-delete.md) API, which sends the item to the recycle bin. Therefore, permanently deleted drive items can't be restored afterward.
