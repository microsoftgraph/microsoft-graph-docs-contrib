# industryDataRun: start

Namespace: microsoft.graph.industryData

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Start a new [industryDataRun](../resources/industrydata-industrydatarun.md). Industry data automates a run every 12 hours; however, users can use the start action to perform an on-demand run. The industry data service throttles the start of runs, allowing up to five successful runs every 12 hours. An on-demand run causes the next system-scheduled run to be skipped if it is set to run within the next 10 hours.
