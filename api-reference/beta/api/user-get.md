# Get user

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Retrieve the properties and relationships of [user](../resources/user.md) object.

This operation returns by default only a subset of the more commonly used properties for each user. These _default_ properties are noted in the [Properties](../resources/user.md#properties) section. To get properties that are _not_ returned by default, do a [GET operation](user-get.md) for the user and specify the properties in a `$select` OData query option. Because the **user** resource supports [extensions](/graph/extensibility-overview), you can also use the `GET` operation to get custom properties and extension data in a **user** instance.

Customers through Microsoft Entra ID for customers can also use this API operation to retrieve their details.

[!INCLUDE [national-cloud-support](../../includes/all-clouds.md)]

## Permissions
Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](/graph/permissions-reference).

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored", "name": "user_get" } -->
[!INCLUDE [permissions-table](../includes/permissions/user-get-permissions.md)]

>[!NOTE]
> The `User.Read` permission allows the app to read the profile, and discover relationships such as the group membership, reports, and manager of the signed-in user only.

### Permissions for specific scenarios
- To read the **employeeLeaveDateTime** property:
  - In delegated scenarios, the signed-in user needs at least one of the following Microsoft Entra roles: *Lifecycle Workflows Administrator* (least privilege), *Global Reader*; the app must be granted the *User-LifeCycleInfo.Read.All* delegated permission.
  - In app-only scenarios with Microsoft Graph permissions, the app must be granted the *User-LifeCycleInfo.Read.All* permission.
- To read the **customSecurityAttributes** property:
  - In delegated scenarios, the signed-in user must be assigned the *Attribute Assignment Administrator* role and the app granted the *CustomSecAttributeAssignment.Read.All* permission.
  - In app-only scenarios with Microsoft Graph permissions, the app must be granted the *CustomSecAttributeAssignment.Read.All* permission.
- *User-Mail.ReadWrite.All* is the least privileged permission to read and write the **otherMails** property; also allows to read some identifier-related properties on the user object.
- *User-PasswordProfile.ReadWrite.All* is the least privileged permission to read and write password reset-related properties; also allows to read some identifier-related properties on the user object.
- *User-Phone.ReadWrite.All* is the least privileged permission to read and write the **businessPhones** and **mobilePhone** properties; also allows to read some identifier-related properties on the user object.
- *User.EnableDisableAccount.All* + *User.Read.All* is the least privileged combination of permissions to read and write the **accountEnabled** property.

## HTTP request

For a specific user:
<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
GET /me
GET /users/{id | userPrincipalName}
```

[!INCLUDE [me-apis-sign-in-note](../includes/me-apis-sign-in-note.md)]

> [!TIP]
>
> + When the **userPrincipalName** begins with a `$` character, the GET request URL syntax `/users/$x@y.com` fails with a `400 Bad Request` error code. The request fails because the URL violates the OData URL convention, which expects only system query options to be prefixed with a `$` character. Remove the slash (/) after `/users` and enclose the **userPrincipalName** in parentheses and single quotes, as follows: `/users('$x@y.com')`. For example, `/users('$AdeleVance@contoso.com')`.
> + To query a B2B user using the **userPrincipalName**, encode the hash (#) character. That is, replace the `#` symbol with `%23`. For example, `/users/AdeleVance_adatum.com%23EXT%23@contoso.com`.

For the signed-in user:
<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
GET /me
```

[!INCLUDE [me-apis-sign-in-note](../includes/me-apis-sign-in-note.md)]

## Optional query parameters

This method supports the `$select` [OData query parameter](/graph/query-parameters) to retrieve specific user properties, including those not returned by default. Extension properties also support query parameters as follows:

| Extension type                     | Comments                                                                            |
|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| onPremisesExtensionAttributes 1-15 | Returned only with `$select`.                                                       |
| Schema extensions                  | Returned only with `$select`.                                                       |
| Open extensions                    | Returned only through the [Get open extension](opentypeextension-get.md) operation. |
| Directory extensions               | Returned only with `$select`.                                                       |

## Request headers

| Header       | Value|
|:-----------|:------|
|Authorization|Bearer {token}. Required. Learn more about [authentication and authorization](/graph/auth/auth-concepts).|

## Request body

Don't supply a request body for this method.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and [user](../resources/user.md) object in the response body. It returns the default properties unless you use `$select` to specify specific properties. This method returns `202 Accepted` when the request has been processed successfully but the server requires more time to complete related background operations.

If a user with the ID doesn't exist, this method returns a `404 Not Found` error code.

### Example 4: Get the custom security attribute assignments for a user

The following example shows how to get the custom security attribute assignments for a user.

Attribute #1

- Attribute set: `Engineering`
- Attribute: `Project`
- Attribute data type: Collection of Strings
- Attribute value: `["Baker","Cascade"]`

Attribute #2

- Attribute set: `Engineering`
- Attribute: `CostCenter`
- Attribute data type: Collection of Integers
- Attribute value: `[1001]`

Attribute #3

- Attribute set: `Engineering`
- Attribute: `Certification`
- Attribute data type: Boolean
- Attribute value: `true`

Attribute #4

- Attribute set: `Marketing`
- Attribute: `EmployeeId`
- Attribute data type: String
- Attribute value: `"QN26904"`

To get custom security attribute assignments, the calling principal must be assigned the Attribute Assignment Reader or Attribute Assignment Administrator role and must be granted the *CustomSecAttributeAssignment.Read.All* or *CustomSecAttributeAssignment.ReadWrite.All* permission.

For more examples of custom security attribute assignments, see [Examples: Assign, update, list, or remove custom security attribute assignments using the Microsoft Graph API](/graph/custom-security-attributes-examples).
