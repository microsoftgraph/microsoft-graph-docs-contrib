# Get a user

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Retrieve the properties and relationships of user object.

This operation returns by default only a subset of the more commonly used properties for each user. These _default_ properties are noted in the [Properties](../resources/user.md#properties) section. To get properties that are _not_ returned by default, do a [GET operation](user-get.md) for the user and specify the properties in a `$select` OData query option. Because the **user** resource supports [extensions](/graph/extensibility-overview), you can also use the `GET` operation to get custom properties and extension data in a **user** instance.

## Permissions
One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) | User.Read, User.ReadWrite, User.ReadBasic.All, User.Read.All, User.ReadWrite.All, Directory.Read.All, Directory.ReadWrite.All, Directory.AccessAsUser.All    |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | User.Read, User.ReadWrite    |
|Application | User.Read.All, User.ReadWrite.All, Directory.Read.All, Directory.ReadWrite.All |

Calling the `/me` endpoint requires a signed-in user and therefore a delegated permission. Application permissions are not supported when using the `/me` endpoint.

For a specific user:
<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
GET /users/{id | userPrincipalName}
```

For the signed-in user:
<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
GET /me
```

## Optional query parameters

This method supports the [OData Query Parameters](/graph/query-parameters) to help customize the response.

## Request headers

| Header       | Value|
|:-----------|:------|
| Authorization  | Bearer {token}. Required.|
| Content-Type   | application/json |

## Request body

Do not supply a request body for this method.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and [user](../resources/user.md) object in the response body.

This method returns `202 Accepted` when the request has been processed successfully but the server requires more time to complete related background operations.
