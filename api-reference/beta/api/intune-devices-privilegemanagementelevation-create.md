The following table shows the properties that are required when you create the privilegeManagementElevation.

|Property|Type|Description|
|:---|:---|:---|
|id|String|The unique identifier of the managed elevation event. This will be a Guid generated based on the deviceId and eventDateTime. Example: `{7C1E0E13-D91F-4411-A164-AB5A330E87C7}`|
