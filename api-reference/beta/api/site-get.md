## HTTP request

### Get the tenant's root site

To access the root SharePoint site within a tenant:

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->

```http
GET /sites/root
GET /sites/contoso.sharepoint.com
```

### Access a site by server-relative URL

If you have the server-relative URL for a **site** resource, you can construct a request as follows:

```http

To access the team site for a group:

```http
GET /groups/{group-id}/sites/root
