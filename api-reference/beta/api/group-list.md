# List groups

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

List all the [groups](../resources/group.md) available in an organization, excluding dynamic distribution groups. To retrieve dynamic distribution groups, [use the Exchange admin center](/exchange/recipients/dynamic-distribution-groups/dynamic-distribution-groups).

This operation returns by default only a subset of the more commonly used properties for each group. These _default_ properties are noted in the [Properties](../resources/group.md#properties) section. To get properties that are _not_ returned by default, do a [GET operation](group-get.md) for the group and specify the properties in a `$select` OData query option. The **hasMembersWithLicenseErrors** and **isArchived** properties are an exception and are not returned in the `$select` query.

[!INCLUDE [national-cloud-support](../../includes/all-clouds.md)]

## Permissions

Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](/graph/permissions-reference).

<!-- { "blockType": "permissions", "name": "group_list" } -->
[!INCLUDE [permissions-table](../includes/permissions/group-list-permissions.md)]

## HTTP request

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->

```http
GET /groups
```

## Optional query parameters

This method supports the `$count`, `$expand`, `$filter`, `$orderby`, `$search`, `$select`, and `$top` [OData query parameters](/graph/query-parameters) to help customize the response. `$skip` isn't supported. The default and maximum page sizes are 100 and 999 group objects respectively. Some queries are supported only when you use the **ConsistencyLevel** header set to `eventual` and `$count`. For more information, see [Advanced query capabilities on directory objects](/graph/aad-advanced-queries).

To list only Microsoft 365 groups (unified groups), apply a filter on **groupTypes**:

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->

```http
GET https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/groups?$filter=groupTypes/any(c:c+eq+'Unified')
```

The `$search` query parameter supports tokenization only on the **displayName** and **description** fields and requires the **ConsistencyLevel** header. Fields other than **displayName** and **description** default to `$filter` `startsWith` behavior.

Extension properties also support query parameters as follows:

| Extension type       | Comments                      |
|----------------------|-------------------------------|
| Schema extensions    | Returned only with `$select`. |
| Open extensions      | Returned only with `$expand`. |
| Directory extensions | Returned by default.          |

For more information on OData query options, see [OData query parameters](/graph/query-parameters). For more information about the use of **ConsistencyLevel** and `$count`, see [Advanced query capabilities on directory objects](/graph/aad-advanced-queries).

| ConsistencyLevel | eventual. This header and `$count` are required when using `$search`, or in specific usage of `$filter`. For more information about the use of **ConsistencyLevel** and `$count`, see [Advanced query capabilities on directory objects](/graph/aad-advanced-queries). |

## Request body

Don't supply a request body for this method.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and collection of [group](../resources/group.md) objects in the response body. The response includes only the default properties of each group.

```

### Example 3: Get only a count of groups

#### Request

The following example shows a request. This request requires the **ConsistencyLevel** header set to `eventual` because `$count` is in the request. For more information about the use of **ConsistencyLevel** and `$count`, see [Advanced query capabilities on directory objects](/graph/aad-advanced-queries).

> **Note:** The `$count` and `$search` query parameters are currently not available in Azure AD B2C tenants.

### Example 4: Use $filter and $top to get one group with a display name that starts with 'a' including a count of returned objects

#### Request

The following example shows a request. This request requires the **ConsistencyLevel** header set to `eventual` and the `$count=true` query string because the request has both the `$orderby` and `$filter` query parameters. For more information about the use of **ConsistencyLevel** and `$count`, see [Advanced query capabilities on directory objects](/graph/aad-advanced-queries).

> **Note:** The `$count` and `$search` query parameters are currently not available in Azure AD B2C tenants.

### Example 5: Use $search to get groups with display names that contain the letters 'Video' or a description that contains the letters 'prod' including a count of returned objects

#### Request

### Example 6: List dynamic groups

#### Request

The following example shows a request that filters by the **membershipRuleProcessingState** to retrieve dynamic groups. You may also filter by the **groupTypes** properties (that is, `$filter=groupTypes/any(s:s eq 'DynamicMembership')`). This request requires the **ConsistencyLevel** header set to `eventual` and the `$count=true` query string because the request uses the `not` operator of the `$filter` query parameter. For more information about the use of **ConsistencyLevel** and `$count`, see [Advanced query capabilities on directory objects](/graph/aad-advanced-queries).

> **Note:** The `$count` and `$search` query parameters are currently not available in Azure AD B2C tenants.
