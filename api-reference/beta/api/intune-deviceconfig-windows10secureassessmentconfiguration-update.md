The following table shows the properties that are required when you create the [windows10SecureAssessmentConfiguration](../resources/intune-deviceconfig-windows10secureassessmentconfiguration.md).

|version|Int32|Version of the device configuration. Inherited from [deviceConfiguration](../resources/intune-shared-deviceconfiguration.md)|
|launchUri|String|Url link to an assessment that's automatically loaded when the secure assessment browser is launched. It has to be a valid Url (http\[s\]://msdn.microsoft.com/).|
|configurationAccount|String|The account used to configure the Windows device for taking the test. The user can be a domain account (domain\user), an AAD account (username@tenant.com) or a local account (username).|
