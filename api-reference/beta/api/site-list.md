# List sites

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

List all available [sites][] in an organization.

Specific filter criteria and query options are also supported and described below:

| Filter statement             | Select statement        | Description
|:-----------------------------|:------------------------|:--------------------
|`siteCollection/root ne null` | `siteCollection,webUrl` | Lists all root-level site collections in the organization. Useful for discovering the home site for each geography.

In addition, you can use a **[$search][]** query against the `/sites` collection to find sites matching given keywords.
If you want to list all sites across all geographies, refer to [getAllSites][].

[$search]: site-search.md
[sites]: ../resources/site.md
[getAllSites]: ../api/site-getallsites.md

For more guidance about building applications that use site discovery for scanning purposes, see [Best practices for discovering files and detecting changes at scale](/onedrive/developer/rest-api/concepts/scan-guidance?view=odsp-graph-online&preserve-view=true).
