# List servicePrincipals

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Retrieve a list of [servicePrincipal](../resources/serviceprincipal.md) objects.

[!INCLUDE [national-cloud-support](../../includes/all-clouds.md)]

## Permissions

Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](/graph/permissions-reference).

[!INCLUDE [rbac-serviceprincipal-apis-read](../includes/rbac-for-apis/rbac-serviceprincipal-apis-read.md)]

### Permissions for specific scenarios
- A service principal can retrieve its own application and service principal details without being granted any application permissions.
- The *Application.ReadWrite.OwnedBy* permission allows an app to call `GET /applications` and `GET /servicePrincipals` to list all applications and service principals in the tenant. This scope of access has been allowed for the permission.

## HTTP request

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
GET /servicePrincipals
```

## Optional query parameters

This method supports the `$count`, `$expand`, `$filter`, `$orderby`, `$search`, `$select`, and `$top` [OData query parameters](/graph/query-parameters) to help customize the response. The default and maximum page sizes are 100 and 999 service principal objects respectively. Some queries are supported only when you use the **ConsistencyLevel** header set to `eventual` and `$count`. For more information, see [Advanced query capabilities on directory objects](/graph/aad-advanced-queries).

By default, this API doesn't return the value of the **key** in the **keyCredentials** property when listing all service principals. To retrieve the public key info in **key**, the **keyCredentials** property must be specified in a `$select` query. For example, `$select=id,appId,keyCredentials`.

The use of `$select` to get **keyCredentials** for service principals has a throttling limit of 150 requests per minute for every tenant.

## Request headers

| Name | Description |
|:---- |:----------- |
|Authorization|Bearer {token}. Required. Learn more about [authentication and authorization](/graph/auth/auth-concepts).|
| ConsistencyLevel | eventual. This header and `$count` are required when using `$search`, or in specific usage of `$filter`. For more information about the use of **ConsistencyLevel** and `$count`, see [Advanced query capabilities on directory objects](/graph/aad-advanced-queries). |

## Request body

Don't supply a request body for this method.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and collection of [servicePrincipal](../resources/serviceprincipal.md) objects in the response body.

### Example 3: Use $filter and $top to get one service principal with a display name that starts with 'a' including a count of returned objects

#### Request

The following example shows a request. This request requires the **ConsistencyLevel** header set to `eventual` and the `$count=true` query string because the request has both the `$orderby` and `$filter` query parameters. For more information about the use of **ConsistencyLevel** and `$count`, see [Advanced query capabilities on directory objects](/graph/aad-advanced-queries).

>**Note:** The `$count` and `$search` query parameters are currently not available in Azure AD B2C tenants.
