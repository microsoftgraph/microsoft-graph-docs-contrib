# Delete accessPackage

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Delete an [accessPackage](../resources/accesspackage.md) object.

You cannot delete an access package if it has any **accessPackageAssignment**. To delete the access package, first [query if there are any assignments](entitlementmanagement-list-accesspackageassignments.md) with a filter to indicate the specific access package, such as: `$filter=accessPackage/id eq 'a914b616-e04e-476b-aa37-91038f0b165b'`. For more information on how to remove assignments that are still in the delivered state, see [Remove an assignment](entitlementmanagement-post-accesspackageassignmentrequests.md#example-4-remove-an-assignment).
