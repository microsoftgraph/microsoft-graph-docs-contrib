# List device usageRights
Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Retrieve a list of [usageRight](../resources/usageright.md) objects for a given device.

[!INCLUDE [national-cloud-support](../../includes/global-only.md)]

## Permissions
Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](/graph/permissions-reference).

<!-- { "blockType": "permissions", "name": "device_list_usagerights" } -->
[!INCLUDE [permissions-table](../includes/permissions/device-list-usagerights-permissions.md)]

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In delegated scenarios with work or school accounts, the signed-in user must be assigned a supported [Microsoft Entra role](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference?toc=%2Fgraph%2Ftoc.json) or a custom role with a supported role permission. The following least privileged roles are supported for this operation.
> - Directory Readers
> - Global Reader
> - Intune Administrator
> - Windows 365 Administrator

## HTTP request

You can address the device using either its **id** or **deviceId**.
<!-- {
  "blockType": "ignored"
}
-->
``` http
GET /devices/{objectId}/usageRights
GET /devices(deviceId='{deviceId}')/usageRights
```

## Optional query parameters
This API supports the `$filter` [OData query parameter](/graph/query-parameters). The following patterns of `$filter` are supported:

- $filter = state eq 'value'
- $filter = serviceIdentifier eq 'value'
- $filter = state eq 'value' and serviceIdentifier eq 'value'
- $filter = state in ('value1', 'value2')
- $filter = serviceIdentifier in ('value1', 'value2')
- $filter = state in ('value1', 'value2') and serviceIdentifier in ('value1', 'value2')

## Request headers
|Name|Description|
|:---|:---|
|Authorization|Bearer {token}. Required. Learn more about [authentication and authorization](/graph/auth/auth-concepts).|
|odata.maxpagesize|Set the max result page size pereference. Optional.|

## Request body
Don't supply a request body for this method.

## Response
If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and a collection of [usageRight](../resources/usageright.md) objects in the response body.

Additionally, if there are more pages in the response an @odata.nextLink is returned.
