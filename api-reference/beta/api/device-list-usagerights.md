- $filter = state eq 'value'
- $filter = serviceIdentifier eq 'value'
- $filter = state eq 'value' and serviceIdentifier eq 'value'
- $filter = state in ('value1', 'value2')
- $filter = serviceIdentifier in ('value1', 'value2')
- $filter = state in ('value1', 'value2') and serviceIdentifier in ('value1', 'value2')

## Request headers
|Name|Description|
|:---|:---|
|Authorization|Bearer {token}. Required.|
|odata.maxpagesize|Set the max result page size pereference. Optional.|

## Request body
Do not supply a request body for this method.

## Response
If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and a collection of [usageRight](../resources/usageright.md) objects in the response body.

Additionally, if there are more pages in the response an @odata.nextLink is returned.
