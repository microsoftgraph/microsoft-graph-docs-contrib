# Remove deviceTemplate owner

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Remove an owner from a [deviceTemplate](../resources/devicetemplate.md) object. Owners can self-remove themselves. As an owner, no other administrator roles are necessary to create, update, delete the devices from this template, as well as to add or remove template owners.

All devices linked to the device template must be first [deleted](../api/device-delete.md) before deleting the template itself. Only [registered owners](../api/devicetemplate-list-owners.md) of the template can perform this operation.

## Permissions

Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](/graph/permissions-reference).
