# Update multiTenantOrganizationJoinRequestRecord

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Join a multi-tenant organization, after the owner of the multi-tenant organization adds your tenant to the multi-tenant organization as pending.

Before a tenant added to a multi-tenant organization can participate in the multi-tenant organization, the administrator of the joining tenant must submit a join request.

To allow for asynchronous processing, you must wait a **minimum of 2 hours** between creation and joining a multi-tenant organization.

Furthermore, to allow for asynchronous processing, you must wait **up to 4 hours** before joining a multi-tenant organization is completed.

If successful, this method returns a `204 No Content` response code.

A join request might be unsuccessful. The following are some scenarios:

* The joining tenant isn't added to the multi-tenant organization by its owner.
* The owner or joiner tenant exceeds the maximum number of internal users per tenant.
* The multi-tenant organization would exceed the maximum number of tenants.
* The joining tenant is already part of a different multi-tenant organization.
