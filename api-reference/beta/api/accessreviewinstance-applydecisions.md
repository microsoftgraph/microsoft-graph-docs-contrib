# accessReviewInstance: applyDecisions

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Apply review decisions on an [accessReviewInstance](../resources/accessreviewinstance.md) if the decisions were not applied automatically because the autoApplyDecisionsEnabled property is `false` in the review's [accessReviewScheduleSettings](../resources/accessreviewschedulesettings.md).

The status of the accessReviewInstance must be `Completed` to call this method.
