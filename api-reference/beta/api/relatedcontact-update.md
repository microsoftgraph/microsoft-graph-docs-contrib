# Update relatedContacts

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Update the [relatedContact](../resources/relatedContact.md) collection of an [educationUser](../resources/educationuser.md) object.

> [!NOTE]
> Updating **relatedContacts** replaces the entire collection. It is not possible to add, remove, or update a single contact.

[!INCLUDE [national-cloud-support](../../includes/global-only.md)]
