# Update relatedContacts

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Update the [relatedContact](../resources/relatedContact.md) collection of an [educationUser](../resources/educationuser.md) object.

> [!NOTE]
> Updating **relatedContacts** replaces the entire collection. It is not possible to add, remove, or update a single contact.

## Request body

In the request body, supply a JSON representation of the [relatedContact](../resources/relatedcontact.md) collection.

The following table shows the properties that are required when you update the [educationUser](../resources/educationuser.md).

| Property        | Type                                                        | Description                                    |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This update must be a distinct operation. It cannot be combined with updates to other [educationUser](../resources/educationuser.md) properties.
> For example, updating both **relatedContacts** and **displayName** requires two distinct requests.

## Response
