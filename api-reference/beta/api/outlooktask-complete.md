# outlookTask: complete (deprecated)

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

[!INCLUDE [outlooktask-deprecate-allup](../../includes/outlooktask-deprecate-allup.md)]


Complete an Outlook task which sets the **completedDateTime** property to the current date, and the **status** property to `completed`.

If you are completing a task in a recurring series, in the response, the task collection will contain the completed task in the series, and the next task in the series.

The **completedDateTime** property represents the date when the task is finished. The time portion of **completedDateTime** is set to midnight UTC by default.

By default, this operation (and the POST, GET, and PATCH task operations) returns date-related properties in UTC. You can use the `Prefer: outlook.timezone` header to have all the date-related properties in the response represented in a time zone different than UTC.
