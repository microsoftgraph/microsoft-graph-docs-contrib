# group: evaluateDynamicMembership

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Evaluate whether a user or device is or would be a member of a dynamic [group](../resources/group.md). The membership rule is returned along with other details that were used in the evaluation. You can complete this operation in the following ways:

- Evaluate whether a user or device is a member of a specified dynamic group.
- Evaluate whether a user or device would be a member of a dynamic group based on the ID of the user or device and a membership rule.
