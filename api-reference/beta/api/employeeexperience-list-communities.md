#### Response

If the number of communities exceeds 20 or you use the `$top` query parameter to set the page size of results, multiple query requests might be necessary to retrieve all results. In this scenario, the API continues to return a reference to the next page of results in the **@odata.nextLink** property with each response until no more pages remain to be retrieved.

The following example shows the response that includes the **@odata.nextLink** property.
