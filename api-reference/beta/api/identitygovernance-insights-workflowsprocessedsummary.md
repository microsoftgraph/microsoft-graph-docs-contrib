# insights: workflowsProcessedSummary

Namespace: microsoft.graph.identityGovernance

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Provide a summary of all workflows processed within a tenant for a specified period. Because the amount of results for listed workflows as returned by the [List workflows](../api/identitygovernance-lifecycleworkflowscontainer-list-workflows.md) does not tell you which workflows were processed from the list of created workflows, this summary gives you a quick overview of processed status based on counts.
