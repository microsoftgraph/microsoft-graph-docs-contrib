# Delete schemaExtension

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Delete the definition of a [schema extension](../resources/schemaextension.md). In app-only scenarios, only the app that created the schema extension (owner app) can delete the schema extension definition, and only when the extension is in the `InDevelopment` state. In delegated scenarios, the owner of the owner app can delete the schema extension definition, and only when the extension is in the `InDevelopment` state. 

Deleting a schema extension definition before deleting the data associated with the extension in the target resources makes the data inaccessible. To recover the data, you can recreate the schema extension definition with the same configuration, but only if you used the verified domain for the schema extension **id**.
