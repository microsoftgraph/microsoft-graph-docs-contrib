# application: delta

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Get newly created, updated, or deleted applications without having to perform a full read of the entire resource collection. For more information, see [Use delta query to track changes in Microsoft Graph data](/graph/delta-query-overview) for details.

[!INCLUDE [national-cloud-support](../../includes/all-clouds.md)]

## Permissions

Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](/graph/permissions-reference).

## HTTP request

To begin tracking changes, you make a request including the delta function on the application resource. 

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
GET /applications/delta
```

### Query parameters

Tracking changes incurs a round of one or more **delta** function calls. If you use any query parameter 
(other than `$deltatoken` and `$skiptoken`), you must specify 
it in the initial **delta** request. Microsoft Graph automatically encodes any specified parameters 
into the token portion of the `@odata.nextLink` or `@odata.deltaLink` URL provided in the response. 
You only need to specify any desired query parameters once upfront. 
In subsequent requests, copy and apply the `@odata.nextLink` or `@odata.deltaLink` URL from the previous response, as that URL already 
includes the encoded, desired parameters.

| Query parameter       | Type    |Description|
|:---------------|:--------|:----------|
| $deltatoken | string | A [state token](/graph/delta-query-overview) returned in the `@odata.deltaLink` URL of the previous **delta** function call for the same resource collection, indicating the completion of that round of change tracking. Save and apply the entire `@odata.deltaLink` URL including this token in the first request of the next round of change tracking for that collection.|
| $skiptoken | string | A [state token](/graph/delta-query-overview) returned in the `@odata.nextLink` URL of the previous **delta** function call, indicating there are further changes to be tracked in the same resource collection. |

## Optional query parameters

This method supports OData Query Parameters to help customize the response.

- You can use a `$select` query parameter as in any GET request to specify only the properties your need for best performance. The 
_id_ property is always returned. 

- There is limited support for `$filter`:
  * The only supported `$filter` expression is for tracking changes for specific resources, by their id:  `$filter=id+eq+{value}` or `$filter=id+eq+{value1}+or+id+eq+{value2}`. The number of ids you can specify is limited by the maximum URL length.


## Request headers
| Name       | Description|
|:---------------|:----------|
|Authorization|Bearer {token}. Required. Learn more about [authentication and authorization](/graph/auth/auth-concepts).|
| Content-Type  | application/json |

## Request body
Don't supply a request body for this method.

### Response

If successful, this method returns `200 OK` response code and [application](../resources/application.md) collection object in the response body. The response also includes a nextLink URL or a deltaLink URL. 

- If a `@odata.nextLink` URL is returned, there are more pages of data to be retrieved in the session. The application continues making requests by using the `@odata.nextLink` URL until a `@odata.deltaLink` URL is included in the response.

- If a `@odata.deltaLink` URL is returned, there is no more data about the existing state of the resource to be returned. Persist and use the `@odata.deltaLink` URL to learn about changes to the resource in the future.
