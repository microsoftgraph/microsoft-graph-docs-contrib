# Upsert application

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Create a new [application](../resources/application.md) object if it doesn't exist, or update the properties of an existing [application](../resources/application.md) object.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Using PATCH to set [**passwordCredential**](../resources/passwordcredential.md) is not supported. Use the [addPassword](./application-addpassword.md) and [removePassword](./application-removepassword.md) methods to update the password or secret for an application.

[!INCLUDE [national-cloud-support](../../includes/all-clouds.md)]

## Permissions
Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](/graph/permissions-reference).

## HTTP request

To create or update an application, specify the **uniqueName** client-provided alternate key.

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
PATCH /applications(uniqueName='{uniqueName}')
```

## Request headers
| Name          | Description|
|:--------------|:----------|
| Authorization |Bearer {token}. Required. Learn more about [authentication and authorization](/graph/auth/auth-concepts).|
| Content-Type  | application/json. Required. |
| Prefer        | `create-if-missing`. Required for upsert behavior, otherwise the request is treated as an update operation. |

## Request body

In the request body, supply a JSON representation of the [application](../resources/application.md) object. The request body must contain  **displayName**, which is a required property. Specify other writable properties as necessary for your application, for creation or update.

## Response

If an application object with **uniqueName** doesn't exist, this method returns a `201 Created` response code and a new [application](../resources/application.md) object in the response body. The application is assigned the uniqueName value.

If an application object with **uniqueName** doesn't exist and the `Prefer: create-if-missing` header is *not* specified, this method returns a `404 Not Found` error code.

If an application object with **uniqueName** already exists, this method updates the [application](../resources/application.md) object and returns a `204 No Content` response code.

## Examples

### Example 1: Create a new application if it doesn't exist

The following example creates an application because an application with the specified **uniqueName** value doesn't exist.
