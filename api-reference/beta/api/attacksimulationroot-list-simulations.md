# List simulations
Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Get a list of attack simulation campaigns for a tenant.

[!INCLUDE [national-cloud-support](../../includes/global-only.md)]

## Permissions
Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](/graph/permissions-reference).

<!-- { "blockType": "permissions", "name": "attacksimulationroot_list_simulations" } -->
[!INCLUDE [permissions-table](../includes/permissions/attacksimulationroot-list-simulations-permissions.md)]

## HTTP request

<!-- {
  "blockType": "ignored"
}
-->
``` http
GET /security/attackSimulation/simulations
```

## Optional query parameters

This method supports the `$count`, `$filter`, `$orderby`, `$skipToken`, `$top`, and `$select` [OData query parameters](/graph/query-parameters) to help customize the response. You can use the `$filter` and `$orderby` query parameters on the **attackTechnique**, **attackType**, **completionDateTime**, **displayName**, **isAutomated**, **launchDateTime**, and **status** properties.

If the result set spans multiple pages, the response body contains an `@odata.nextLink` that you can use to page through the result set.

The following are examples of their use:

<!-- {
  "blockType": "ignored"
}
-->
``` http
GET /security/attackSimulation/simulations?$count=true
GET /security/attackSimulation/simulations?$filter={property} eq '{property-value}'
GET /security/attackSimulation/simulations?$filter={property} eq '{property-value}'&$top=5
GET /security/attackSimulation/simulations?$orderby={property}
GET /security/attackSimulation/simulations?$skipToken={skipToken}
GET /security/attackSimulation/simulations?$top=1
GET /security/attackSimulation/simulations?$select={property}
```

## Request headers
|Name|Description|
|:---|:---|
|Authorization|Bearer {token}. Required. Learn more about [authentication and authorization](/graph/auth/auth-concepts).|

## Request body
Don't supply a request body for this method.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and a collection of [simulation](../resources/simulation.md) objects in the response body.
