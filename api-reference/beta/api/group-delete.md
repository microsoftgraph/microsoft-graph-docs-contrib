# Delete group

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

When deleted, Microsoft 365 groups are moved to a temporary container and can be restored within 30 days. After that time, they are permanently deleted. This isn't applicable to Security groups and Distribution groups that are permanently deleted immediately. To learn more, see [deletedItems](../resources/directory.md).
