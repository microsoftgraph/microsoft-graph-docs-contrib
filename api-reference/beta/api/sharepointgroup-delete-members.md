# Delete sharePointGroupMember

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Delete a [sharePointGroupMember](../resources/sharepointgroupmember.md) object from a [sharePointGroup](../resources/sharepointgroup.md). The deleted member immediately loses the permissions they inherit from the **sharePointGroup**. It may take several minutes for substrate-related functionality, such as search and Copilot, to reflect the deletion of the **sharePointGroupMember**.
