# Create multiTenantOrganization
Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Create a new multi-tenant organization. By default, the creator tenant becomes an owner tenant upon successful creation. Only owner tenants can manage a multi-tenant organization.

To allow for asynchronous processing, you must wait a **minimum of 2 hours** between creation and joining a multi-tenant organization.
