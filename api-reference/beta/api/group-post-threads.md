# Create conversation thread

Start a new group conversation by first creating a thread.

A new conversation, conversation thread, and post are created in the group. Use [reply thread](conversationthread-reply.md) or [reply post](post-reply.md) to further post to that thread.

Note: You can also [start a new thread in an existing conversation](conversation-post-threads.md).
