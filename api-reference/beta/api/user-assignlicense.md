[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Add or remove licenses for the user to enable or disable their use of Microsoft cloud offerings. For example, an organization can have a Microsoft 365 Enterprise E3 subscription with 100 licenses, and this request assigns one of those licenses to a specific user.

To learn more about subscriptions and licenses, see this [Technet article](/microsoft-365/enterprise/subscriptions-licenses-accounts-and-tenants-for-microsoft-cloud-offerings).

To get the subscriptions available in the directory, perform a [GET subscribedSkus request](subscribedsku-list.md).
