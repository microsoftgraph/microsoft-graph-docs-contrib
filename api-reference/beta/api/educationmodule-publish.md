# educationModule: publish

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Change the state of an [educationModule](../resources/educationmodule.md) from its original `draft` status to the `published` status.

Only teachers in the class can perform this operation. When a module is in draft status, students won't see the module. When you call this API, the module appears in the student's class work list.
