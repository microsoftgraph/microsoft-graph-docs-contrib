# List associatedTeamInfo
Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Get the list of [teams](../resources/associatedteaminfo.md) in Microsoft Teams that a [user](../resources/user.md) is associated with.
Currently, a [user](../resources/user.md) can be associated with a [team](../resources/team.md) in two different ways:
* A [user](../resources/user.md) can be a direct member of a [team](../resources/team.md).
* A [user](../resources/user.md) can be a member of a shared [channel](../resources/channel.md) that is hosted inside a [team](../resources/team.md).

Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](/graph/permissions-reference).
