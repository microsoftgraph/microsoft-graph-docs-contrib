# List accessPackageResourceRoles

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Retrieve a list of [accessPackageResourceRole](../resources/accesspackageresourcerole.md) objects of an [accessPackageResource](../resources/accesspackageresource.md) in an [accessPackageCatalog](../resources/accesspackagecatalog.md). The resource should have been added to the catalog by [creating an accessPackageResourceRequest](accesspackageresourcerequest-post.md). This list of roles can then be used by the caller to select a role, which is needed when subsequently [creating an accessPackageResourceRoleScope](accesspackage-post-accesspackageresourcerolescopes.md).

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-type: application/json

  "value": [
    {

### Example 2: Retrieve the roles of a resource for a SharePoint Online site

This is an example of retrieving the roles of a resource, to obtain the **originId** of each role.  This would be used after a SharePoint Online site has been added as a resource to the catalog, as the **originId** of a role is needed to add the role to an access package.

#### Request

The following is an example of the request, to retrieve the roles of a particular resource **53c71803-a0a8-4777-aecc-075de8ee3991** which has an **originSystem** of **SharePointOnline** and is located in catalog **beedadfe-01d5-4025-910b-84abb9369997**.
