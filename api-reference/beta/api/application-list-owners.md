## Permissions
Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions).

[!INCLUDE [limited-info](../../includes/limited-info.md)]

> [!IMPORTANT]
> 
> In delegated scenarios with work or school accounts, the signed-in user must be assigned a supported [Microsoft Entra role](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference?toc=%2Fgraph%2Ftoc.json) or a custom role with a supported role permission. The following least privileged roles are supported for this operation.
> - A non-admin member or guest user with default user permissions
> - Application Developer - for the application they own
> - Directory Readers
> - Global Secure Access Administrator
> - Global Reader
> - Hybrid Identity Administrator
> - Cloud Application Administrator
> - Application Administrator

## HTTP request

You can address the application using either its **id** or **appId**. **id** and **appId** are referred to as the **Object ID** and **Application (Client) ID**, respectively, in app registrations in the Microsoft Entra admin center.

```http
GET /applications/{id}/owners
GET /applications(appId='{appId}')/owners
```

## Optional query parameters
This method supports the `$count`, `$expand`, `$filter`, `$orderby`, `$search`, `$select`, and `$top` [OData query parameters](/graph/query-parameters) to help customize the response. Some queries are supported only when you use the **ConsistencyLevel** header set to `eventual` and `$count`.

### Response

>**Note:** The response object shown here might be shortened for readability.
