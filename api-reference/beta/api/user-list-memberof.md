# List user memberOf

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Get groups, directory roles and administrative units that the user is a direct member of. This operation is not transitive.

## Permissions

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

| Permission type | Permissions (from least to most privileged) |
|:--------------- |:------------------------------------------- |
| Delegated (work or school account) | Directory.Read.All, Directory.ReadWrite.All, Directory.AccessAsUser.All |
| Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported. |
| Application | Directory.Read.All, Directory.ReadWrite.All |

## HTTP request

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
GET /me/memberOf
or
GET /users/{id | userPrincipalName}/memberOf
```

## Optional query parameters

This method supports the [OData query parameters](/graph/query_parameters) to help customize the response, including `$search`, `$count`, and `$filter`. OData cast is also enabled, for example, you can cast to get just the directoryRoles the user is a member of. You can use `$search` on the **displayName** property. When items are added or updated for this resource, they are specially indexed for use with the `$count` and `$search` query parameters. There can be a slight delay between when an item is added or updated and when it is available in the index.

## Request headers

| Header | Value |
|:------ |:----- |
| Authorization  | Bearer {token}. Required. |
| ConsistencyLevel | eventual. This header and `$count` are required when using the `$search`, `$filter`, `$orderby`, or OData cast query parameters. It uses an index that might not be up-to-date with recent changes to the object. |

## Request body

Do not supply a request body for this method.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and collection of [directoryObject](../resources/directoryobject.md) objects in the response body.
