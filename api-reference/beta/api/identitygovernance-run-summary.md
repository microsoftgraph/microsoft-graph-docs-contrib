# run: summary

Namespace: microsoft.graph.identityGovernance

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Get a summary of [runs](identitygovernance-run-get.md) for a specified time period. Because the amount of runs returned by the List API call can be overwhelming, this summary allows the administrator to get a quick overview based on counts.
