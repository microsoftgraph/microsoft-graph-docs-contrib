### Example 2: Changing API connector to use client certificate authentication

> **Note:** This will overwrite any previous authenticationConfiguration settings. To change from Basic authentication to certificate authentication, use this. To add additional certificates to list of certificates, use the [Upload client certificate](../api/identityapiconnector-uploadclientcertificate.md) method. When using this method, consequent "Get" or "List" operations of API connectors, `authenticationConfiguration` will be of type [microsoft.graph.clientCertificateAuthentication](../resources/clientcertificateauthentication.md).
