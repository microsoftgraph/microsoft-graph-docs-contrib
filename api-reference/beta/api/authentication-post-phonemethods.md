# Create phoneAuthenticationMethod

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Add a new [phone authentication method](../resources/phoneauthenticationmethod.md). A user may only have one phone of each type, captured in the **phoneType** property. This means, for example, adding a `mobile` phone to a user with a preexisting `mobile` phone will fail. Additionally, a user must always have a `mobile` phone before adding an `alternateMobile` phone.

Adding a phone number makes it available for use in both Azure multi-factor authentication (MFA) and self-service password reset (SSPR), if enabled.

Additionally, if a user is enabled by policy to use SMS sign-in and a `mobile` number is added, the system will attempt to register the number for use in that system.

## Permissions

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

| Permission type                        | Permissions acting on self (from least to most privileged) | Permissions acting on others (from least to most privileged)|
|:---------------------------------------|:-------------------------|:-----------------|
| Delegated (work or school account)     | Not supported. | UserAuthenticationMethod.ReadWrite.All |
| Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported. | Not supported. |
| Application                            | Not supported. | Not supported. |

For delegated scenarios where an admin is acting on another user, the admin needs [one of the following roles](/azure/active-directory/users-groups-roles/directory-assign-admin-roles#available-roles):

* Global admin
* Privileged authentication admin
* Authentication admin
