Update the properties of a workplace sensor device.

[!INCLUDE [national-cloud-support](../../includes/global-only.md)]

## Permissions
Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](/graph/permissions-reference).

> [!NOTE]
> For an app with delegated permissions to write workplace devices, the signed-in user must be a member of the **TenantPlacesManagement** Exchange Online administrator role.

## HTTP request

<!-- {
  "blockType": "ignored"
}
-->
``` http
PATCH /workplace/sensorDevices/{id}
```

## Request headers
|Name|Description|
|:---|:---|
|Authorization|Bearer {token}. Required. Learn more about [authentication and authorization](/graph/auth/auth-concepts).|
|Content-Type|application/json. Required.|

## Request body

In the request body, provide the entire JSON for the [workplaceSensorDevice](../resources/workplacesensordevice.md) object with updated fields. Partial updates aren't supported. If any optional property is excluded, it's set to null. To add new sensors, append a new sensor object to the existing sensor collection. If a sensor object is removed from the collection, it's deleted from the device.

The following table specifies the properties that can be updated.

|Property|Type|Description|
|:---|:---|:---|
|description|String|The description of the device. Optional.|
|deviceId|String|The user-defined unique identifier of the device provided at the time of creation. Required. Read-only.|
|displayName|String|The display name of the device. Optional.|
|ipV4Address|String|The IPv4 address of the device. Optional.|
|ipV6Address|String|The IPv6 address of the device. Optional.|
|macAddress|String|The MAC address of the device. Optional.|
|manufacturer|String|The manufacturer of the device. Required.|
|placeId|String|The unique identifier of the place where the device is located. If the device is installed in a room equipped with a mailbox, this property should match the **ExternalDirectoryObjectId** or Microsoft Entra object ID of the room mailbox. Optional.|
|sensors|[workplaceSensor](../resources/workplacesensor.md) collection|A list of sensors associated with the device that collect and report data about physical or environmental conditions, such as occupancy, people count, inferred occupancy, temperature, and more. Required.|
|tags|String collection|A list of custom tags associated with the device. Supports `$filter`. Optional.|


## Response

If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and an updated [workplaceSensorDevice](../resources/workplacesensordevice.md) object in the response body.
