# presence: clearPresence

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Clear a [presence session](presence-setpresence.md#presence-sessions) of an application for a user. If it is the user's only presence session, a successful **clearPresence** changes the user's presence to `Offline/Offline`.

Read more about [presence sessions](presence-setpresence.md#presence-sessions) and their [time-out and expiration](presence-setpresence.md#timeout-expiration-and-keep-alive).
