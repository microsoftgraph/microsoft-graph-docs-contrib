## HTTP request

<!-- {
  "blockType": "ignored"
}
-->
``` http
GET /security/attackSimulation/simulationAutomations/{simulationAutomationId}/runs
```

## Optional query parameters
This method supports the `$count`, `$skipToken`, `$top`, and `$select` [OData query parameters](/graph/query-parameters) to help customize the response.

If the result set spans multiple pages, the response body contains an `@odata.nextLink` that you can use to page through the result set.

The following are examples of their use:

<!-- {
  "blockType": "ignored"
}
-->
``` http
GET /security/attackSimulation/simulationautomations/{simulationAutomationId}/runs?$count=true
GET /security/attackSimulation/simulationautomations/{simulationAutomationId}/runs?$skipToken={skipToken}
GET /security/attackSimulation/simulationautomations/{simulationAutomationId}/runs?$top=1
GET /security/attackSimulation/simulationautomations/{simulationAutomationId}/runs?$select={property}
```

## Request headers
|Name|Description|
