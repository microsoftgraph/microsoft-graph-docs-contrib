# checkMemberGroups

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Check for membership in the specified list of groups. Returns from the list those groups of which
the user has a direct or transitive membership.

You can check up to a maximum of 20 groups per request. This function supports Microsoft 365 and other
types of groups provisioned in Azure AD. Note that Microsoft 365 groups cannot contain groups. So membership
in a Microsoft 365 group is always direct.
