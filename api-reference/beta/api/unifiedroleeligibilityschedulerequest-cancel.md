# unifiedRoleEligibilityScheduleRequest: cancel
Namespace: microsoft.graph

Immediately cancel a [unifiedRoleEligibilityScheduleRequest](../resources/unifiedroleeligibilityschedulerequest.md) that is in a `Granted` status, and have the system automatically delete the cancelled request after 30 days. After calling this action, the **status** of the cancelled unifiedRoleEligibilityScheduleRequest changes to `Revoked`.
