# user: findRoomLists

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Get the room lists defined in a tenant, as represented by their [emailAddress](../resources/emailaddress.md) objects.

Tenants can organize meeting rooms into room lists. In this API, each meeting room and room list is represented by an [emailAddress](../resources/emailaddress.md) instance.
You can get all the room lists in the tenant, [get all the rooms](user-findrooms.md) in the tenant, or [get all the rooms](user-findrooms.md) in a specific room list.
