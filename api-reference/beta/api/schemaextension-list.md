# List schemaExtensions

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Get a list of [schemaExtension](../resources/schemaextension.md) objects in your tenant. The schema extensions can be `InDevelopment`, `Available`, or `Deprecated` and includes schema extensions:
+ Created by any apps you own in the current tenant.
+ Owned by other apps that are marked as `Available`.
+ Created by other developers from other tenants and marked as `Available`. This is different from other APIs that only return tenant-specific data. Extension data created based on schema extension definitions is tenant-specific and can only be accessed by apps explicitly granted permission. 

[!INCLUDE [national-cloud-support](../../includes/all-clouds.md)]

## Permissions
Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](/graph/permissions-reference).
