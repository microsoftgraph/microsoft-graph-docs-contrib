# List schemaExtensions

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Get a list of [schemaExtension](../resources/schemaextension.md) objects in your tenant. The schema extensions can be `InDevelopment`, `Available`, or `Deprecated` and includes schema extensions:
+ Created by any apps you own in the current tenant.
+ Owned by other apps that are marked as `Available`.
+ Created by other developers from other tenants and marked as `Available`. This is different from other APIs that only return tenant-specific data. Extension data created based on schema extension definitions is tenant-specific and can only be accessed by apps explicitly granted permission. 

## Permissions
One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).


|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |

|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported.    |
|Application | Application.Read.All  |
