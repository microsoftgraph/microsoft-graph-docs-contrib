# Update device

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Update the properties of a device. Only certain properties of a device can be updated through approved Mobile Device Management (MDM) apps.

[!INCLUDE [national-cloud-support](../../includes/all-clouds.md)]

## Permissions
Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](/graph/permissions-reference).

<!-- { "blockType": "permissions", "name": "device_update" } -->
[!INCLUDE [permissions-table](../includes/permissions/device-update-permissions.md)]

In application-only scenarios and for non-Windows devices, that is, where the **operatingSystem** property is not `Windows`, the app can update only the **extensionAttributes** property.

The calling user must also be in at least one of the following [Microsoft Entra roles](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference?toc=%2Fgraph%2Ftoc.json): *Intune Administrator* or *Windows 365 Administrator*. A calling user in the *Cloud Device Administrator* role can only enable or disable devices using this API and a user with the *Windows 365 Administrator* role can only update basic device properties. A Global Administrator has full management privileges over the device.

## HTTP request

You can address the device using either its **id** or **deviceId**.
<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
PATCH /devices/{id}
PATCH /devices(deviceId='{deviceId}')
```

## Request headers
| Name       |Description|
|:-----------|:------|
|Authorization|Bearer {token}. Required. Learn more about [authentication and authorization](/graph/auth/auth-concepts).|

## Request body

In the request body, supply the values for the [device](../resources/device.md) properties that should be updated. Existing properties that are not included in the request body will maintain their previous values or be recalculated based on changes to other property values. For best performance you shouldn't include existing values that haven't changed.

| Property       | Type    |Description|
|:---------------|:--------|:----------|
|accountEnabled|Boolean| `true` if the account is enabled; otherwise, `false`. Only callers in Global Administrator and Cloud Device Administrator roles can update this property. |
|operatingSystem|String|The type of operating system on the device.|
|operatingSystemVersion|String|The version of the operating system on the device|
|displayName|String|The display name for the device.|
|isCompliant|Boolean|`true` if the device complies with Mobile Device Management (MDM) policies; otherwise, `false`. This can only be updated by Intune for any device OS type or by an [approved MDM app](/windows/client-management/mdm/azure-active-directory-integration-with-mdm) for Windows OS devices. |
|isManaged|Boolean|`true` if the device is managed by a Mobile Device Management (MDM) app; otherwise, `false`. This can only be updated by Intune for any device OS type or by an [approved MDM app](/windows/client-management/mdm/azure-active-directory-integration-with-mdm) for Windows OS devices. |

Since the **device** resource supports [extensions](/graph/extensibility-overview), you can use the `PATCH` operation to 
add, update, or delete your own app-specific data in custom properties of an extension in an existing **device** instance.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `204 No Content` response code.
