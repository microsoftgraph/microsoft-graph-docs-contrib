# Delete subscription

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Delete a subscription.

For the list of resources that support subscribing to change notifications, see the table in the [Permissions](#permissions) section.

[!INCLUDE [national-cloud-support](../../includes/all-clouds.md)]

## Permissions

Depending on the resource and the permission type (delegated or application) requested, the permission specified in the following table is the least privileged required to call this API. To learn more, including [taking caution](/graph/auth/auth-concepts#best-practices-for-requesting-permissions) before choosing more privileged permissions, search for the following permissions in [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

> [!NOTE]
> Some resources support change notifications in multiple scenarios, each of which may require different permissions. In those cases, use the resource path to differentiate the scenarios.

<!-- ### aiInteraction -->
[!INCLUDE [copilot-aiinteraction-subscription-notes.md](../../includes/copilot-aiinteraction-subscription-notes.md)]

### driveItem

More limitations apply to subscriptions on OneDrive items. The limitations apply to creating as well as managing (getting, updating, and deleting) subscriptions.

On a personal OneDrive, you can subscribe to the root folder or any subfolder in that drive. On OneDrive for work or school, you can subscribe to only the root folder. Change notifications are sent for the requested types of changes on the subscribed folder or any file, folder, or other **driveItem** instances in its hierarchy. You can't subscribe to **drive** or **driveItem** instances that aren't folders, such as individual files.

### contact, event, and message

You can subscribe to changes in Outlook **contact**, **event**, or **message** resources and optionally specify in the POST request payload whether to include encrypted resource data in notifications.

[!INCLUDE [outlook-subscription-notes](../../includes/outlook-subscription-notes.md)]

### onlineMeetings, presence

**onlineMeetings** and **presence** subscriptions require [encryption](/graph/webhooks-with-resource-data) for notifications with resource data. Subscription creation fails if [encryptionCertificate](../resources/subscription.md) and [encryptionCertificateId](../resources/subscription.md) aren't specified if resource data is desired in notifications.
For details about online meeting subscriptions, see [Get change notifications for online meetings](/graph/changenotifications-for-onlinemeeting).

### virtualEventWebinar

Subscriptions on virtual events support only basic notifications and are limited to a few entities of a virtual event. For more information on the supported subscription types, see [Get change notifications for Microsoft Teams virtual event updates](/graph/changenotifications-for-virtualevent).
