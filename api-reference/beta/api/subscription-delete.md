Delete a subscription.

For the list of resources that support subscribing to change notifications, see the table in the [Permissions](#permissions) section.

## Permissions

Depending on the resource and the permission type (delegated or application) requested, the permission specified in the following table is the least privileged required to call this API. To learn more, including [taking caution](/graph/auth/auth-concepts#best-practices-for-requesting-permissions) before choosing more privileged permissions, search for the following permissions in [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

> **Note**: 
>
> Some resources support change notifications in multiple scenarios, each of which may require different permissions. In those cases, use the resource path to differentiate the scenarios.
>
> Permissions marked with * use [resource-specific consent](/microsoftteams/platform/graph-api/rsc/resource-specific-consent).

### driveItem

Additional limitations apply for subscriptions on OneDrive items. The limitations apply to creating as well as managing (getting, updating, and deleting) subscriptions.

On a personal OneDrive, you can subscribe to the root folder or any subfolder in that drive. On OneDrive for Business, you can subscribe to only the root folder. Change notifications are sent for the requested types of changes on the subscribed folder, or any file, folder, or other **driveItem** instances in its hierarchy. You cannot subscribe to **drive** or **driveItem** instances that are not folders, such as individual files.

### contact, event, and message

You can subscribe to changes in Outlook **contact**, **event**, or **message** resources and optionally specify in the POST request payload whether to include encrypted resource data in notifications.

[!INCLUDE [outlook-subscription-notes](../../includes/outlook-subscription-notes.md)]

### onlineMeetings, presence

**onlineMeetings** and **presence** subscriptions require [encryption](/graph/webhooks-with-resource-data) for notifications with resource data. Subscription creation will fail if [encryptionCertificate](../resources/subscription.md) and [encryptionCertificateId](../resources/subscription.md) are not specified if resource data is desired in notifications.
For details about online meeting subscriptions, see [Get change notifications for online meetings](/graph/changenotifications-for-onlinemeeting).
