GET /communications/callRecords/getSmsLog(fromDateTime={fromDateTime},toDateTime={toDateTime})
```

## Function parameters

In the request URL, provide the following query parameters with values.

|Parameter|Type|Description|
|:---|:---|:---|
|fromDateTime|DateTimeOffset|Start of time range to query. The Timestamp type represents date and time information using ISO 8601 format and is always in UTC time. For example, midnight UTC on Jan 1, 2014 is `2014-01-01T00:00:00Z`. Required.|

## Request body

Don't supply a request body for this method.

## Response

If successful, this function returns a `200 OK` response code and a collection of [microsoft.graph.callRecords.smsLogRow](../resources/callrecords-smslogrow.md) entries in the response body.
  
If the function returns more than 1,000 entries for the specified date range, the body also includes an `@odata.nextLink` with a URL to query the next page of entries. The last page in the date range doesn't have an `@odata.nextLink`. For more information, see [paging Microsoft Graph data in your app](/graph/paging).

## Example

The following example shows how to get the log of sent/received SMS that occurred in the specified date range. The response includes `"@odata.count": 1000` to enumerate the number of records in this first response, and an `@odata.nextLink` to get records beyond the first 1,000. For readability, the response object contains only a collection of one record.
