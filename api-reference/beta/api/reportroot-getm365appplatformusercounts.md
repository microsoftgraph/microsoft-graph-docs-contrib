## HTTP request

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } --> 

```http
GET /reports/getM365AppPlatformUserCounts(period='{period_value}')
```

## Function parameters

In the request URL, provide the following parameter with a valid value.

| Parameter | Type   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| :-------- | :----- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| period    | string | Specifies the length of time over which the report is aggregated. The supported values for {period_value} are: `D7`, `D30`, `D90`, and `D180`. These values follow the format D*n* where *n* represents the number of days over which the report is aggregated. Required. |

## Optional query parameters

This method supports the `$format` [OData query parameter](/graph/query-parameters) to customize the response. The default output type is text/csv. However, if you want to specify the output type, you can use the OData `$format` query parameter to set the default output to text/csv or application/json.

## Request headers

| Name          | Description               |
| :------------ | :------------------------ |
| Authorization | Bearer {token}. Required. |

## Request body

Do not supply a request body with this method.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and a [report](../resources/intune-shared-report.md) object in the response body. Report data is contained in the **content** property of the **report** object.

### CSV

If successful, requesting the **content** property returns a `302 Found` response that redirects to a preauthenticated download URL for the report. That URL can be found in the `Location` header in the response.

Preauthenticated download URLs are only valid for a short period of time (a few minutes) and do not require an `Authorization` header.

The CSV file has the following headers for columns:

- Report Refresh Date
- Report Period
- Report Date
- Outlook
- Word
- Excel
- PowerPoint
- OneNote
- Teams

### JSON

If successful, requesting the **content** property returns a `200 OK` response code and a JSON object in response body.
