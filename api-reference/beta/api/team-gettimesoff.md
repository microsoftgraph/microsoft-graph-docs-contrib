# team: getTimesOff

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Get all [time off](../resources/timeoff.md) objects across all teams to which a user is a direct member.

## Permissions

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

<!-- {
  "blockType": "permissions",
  "name": "team-gettimesoff-permissions"
}
-->
[!INCLUDE [permissions-table](../includes/permissions/team-gettimesoff-permissions.md)]

## HTTP request

<!-- {
  "blockType": "ignored"
}
-->
``` http
GET /me/joinedTeams/getTimesOff
GET /users/{id | user-principal-name}/joinedTeams/getTimesOff
```

## Optional query parameters

This method supports the `$top`, `$orderby`, `$select` and `$filter` [OData query parameters](/graph/query-parameters) to help customize the response.

> [!NOTE]
> The `$filter` parameter supports the **sharedTimeOff/startDateTime**, **sharedTimeOff/endDateTime**, **userID** and **teamInfo/teamId** properties. It doesn't support the use of the same property more than once in a query. For example, the following query doesn't work: `sharedTimeOff/startDateTime ge 2024-05-09T00:00:00Z and sharedTimeOff/startDateTime le 2024-05-09T23:59:59Z`; however, the following query works: `sharedTimeOff/startDateTime ge 2024-05-09T00:00:00Z and sharedTimeOff/endDateTime le 2024-05-09T23:59:59Z`.
