        1) Doc bug where 'microsoft.graph.building' isn't defined on the resource.
        2) Doc bug where 'microsoft.graph.building' is an example key and should instead be replaced with a placeholder like {item-id} or declared in the sampleKeys annotation.
        3) Doc bug where 'place' is supposed to be an entity type, but is being treated as a complex because it (and its ancestors) are missing the keyProperty annotation."
