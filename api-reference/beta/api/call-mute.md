# call: mute

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Allows the application to mute itself.

This is a server mute, meaning that the server drops all audio packets for this participant, even if the participant continues to stream audio.

For more information about how to handle mute operations, see [muteParticipantOperation](../resources/muteparticipantoperation.md).

> **Note:** This method is only supported for group calls.

[!INCLUDE [national-cloud-support](../../includes/global-only.md)]
