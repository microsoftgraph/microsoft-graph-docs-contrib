# List accessPackageAssignments

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Retrieve a list of [accessPackageAssignment](../resources/accesspackageassignment.md) objects in [Microsoft Entra entitlement management](../resources/entitlementmanagement-overview.md). For directory-wide administrators, the resulting list includes all the assignments, current and well as expired, that the caller has access to read, across all catalogs and access packages.  If the caller is on behalf of a delegated user who is assigned only to catalog-specific delegated administrative roles, the request must supply a filter to indicate a specific access package, such as: `$filter=accessPackage/id eq 'a914b616-e04e-476b-aa37-91038f0b165b'`.

## HTTP request

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->

```http
GET /identityGovernance/entitlementManagement/accessPackageAssignments
```

## Query parameters

This method supports the `$select`, `$filter`, and `$expand` OData query parameters to help customize the response.

If the user or app is assigned only to catalog-specific administrative roles, the request must supply a filter to indicate a specific access package, such as: `$filter=accessPackage/id eq 'a914b616-e04e-476b-aa37-91038f0b165b'`.

### Example scenarios for using query parameters

- To return the target subject and access package, include `$expand=target,accessPackage`.
- To retrieve only delivered assignments, you can include a query `$filter=assignmentState eq 'Delivered'`.
- To retrieve only assignments for a particular user, you can include a query with assignments targeting the object ID of that user: `$expand=target&$filter=target/objectid+eq+'7deff43e-1f17-44ef-9e5f-d516b0ba11d4'`.
- To retrieve only assignments for a particular user and a particular access package, you can include a query with assignments targeting that access package and the object ID of that user: `$expand=accessPackage,target&$filter=accessPackage/id eq '9bbe5f7d-f1e7-4eb1-a586-38cdf6f8b1ea' and target/objectid eq '7deff43e-1f17-44ef-9e5f-d516b0ba11d4'`.
- To retrieve only assignments resulting from a particular access package assignment policy, you can include a query for that policy: `$filter=accessPackageAssignmentPolicy/id eq 'd92ebb54-9b46-492d-ab7f-01f76767da7f'`.

For general information, see [OData query parameters](/graph/query-parameters).
