# Remove accessReview reviewer (deprecated)

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

[!INCLUDE [accessreviews-disclaimer](../../includes/accessreviews-disclaimer.md)]

In the Microsoft Entra [access reviews](../resources/accessreviews-root.md) feature, update an existing [accessReview](../resources/accessreview.md) object to remove a user as a reviewer.  This operation is only permitted for an access review that isn't yet completed, and only for an access review where the reviewers are explicitly specified. This operation isn't permitted for an access review in which users review their own access, and not intended for an access review in which the group owners are assigned as the reviewers.
