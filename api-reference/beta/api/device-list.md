    {
      "accountEnabled":true,
      "deviceId":"00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",

      "Manufacturer":"Google",
      "Model":"Pixel 3a",
      "operatingSystemVersion":"10.0"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Example 2: Get only a count of devices

#### Request

The following is an example of the request. This request requires the **ConsistencyLevel** header set to `eventual` because `$count` is in the request. For more information about the use of **ConsistencyLevel** and `$count`, see [Advanced query capabilities on Azure AD directory objects](/graph/aad-advanced-queries).

<!-- {
  "blockType": "ignored",
  "name": "get_count_only"
}-->
```msgraph-interactive
GET https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/devices/$count
ConsistencyLevel: eventual
```

#### Response

The following is an example of the response.

<!-- {
  "blockType": "response",
  "truncated": true,
  "@odata.type": "microsoft.graph.device",
  "isCollection": true
} -->
```http

### Example 3: Use $filter and $top to get one device with a display name that starts with 'a' including a count of returned objects

#### Request

The following is an example of the request. This request requires the **ConsistencyLevel** header set to `eventual` and the `$count=true` query string because the request has both the `$orderBy` and `$filter` query parameters. For more information about the use of **ConsistencyLevel** and `$count`, see [Advanced query capabilities on Azure AD directory objects](/graph/aad-advanced-queries).

<!-- {
  "blockType": "ignored",
  "name": "get_a_count"
}-->
```msgraph-interactive
GET https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/devices?$filter=startswith(displayName, 'a')&$count=true&$top=1&$orderby=displayName 
ConsistencyLevel: eventual
```

#### Response

The following is an example of the response.

### Example 4: Use $search to get devices with display names that contain the letters 'Android' including a count of returned objects

#### Request
