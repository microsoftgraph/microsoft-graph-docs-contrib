## HTTP request

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
GET /devices
```

## Optional query parameters

This method supports the `$count`, `$expand`, `$filter`, `$orderBy`, `$search`, `$select`, and `$top` [OData query parameters](/graph/query-parameters) to help customize the response. Some queries are supported only when you use the **ConsistencyLevel** header set to `eventual` and `$count`. For more information, see [Advanced query capabilities on Azure AD directory objects](/graph/aad-advanced-queries).

## Request headers

| Name | Description |
|:---- |:----------- |
| Authorization  | Bearer {token}. Required. |
| ConsistencyLevel | eventual. This header and `$count` are required when using `$search`, or in specific usage of `$filter`. For more information about the use of **ConsistencyLevel** and `$count`, see [Advanced query capabilities on Azure AD directory objects](/graph/aad-advanced-queries). |

## Request body

Do not supply a request body for this method.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and collection of [device](../resources/device.md) objects in the response body.

### Example 4: Use $filter and $top to get one device with a display name that starts with 'a' including a count of returned objects

#### Request

The following is an example of the request. This request requires the **ConsistencyLevel** header set to `eventual` and the `$count=true` query string because the request has both the `$orderBy` and `$filter` query parameters. For more information about the use of **ConsistencyLevel** and `$count`, see [Advanced query capabilities on Azure AD directory objects](/graph/aad-advanced-queries).

>**Note:** The `$count` and `$search` query parameters are currently not available in Azure AD B2C tenants.

}
```

### Example 5: Use $search to get devices with display names that contain the letters 'Android' including a count of returned objects

#### Request

The following is an example of the request. This request requires the **ConsistencyLevel** header set to `eventual` because `$search` and the `$count=true` query string is in the request. For more information about the use of **ConsistencyLevel** and `$count`, see [Advanced query capabilities on Azure AD directory objects](/graph/aad-advanced-queries).

}
```

### Example 6: Get devices using filter on extensionAttributes

#### Request

The following is an example of the request. This request requires the **ConsistencyLevel** header set to `eventual` and the `$count=true` query string because the extensionAttributes property supports `$filter` only with advanced query parameters. For more information about the use of **ConsistencyLevel** and `$count`, see [Advanced query capabilities on Azure AD directory objects](/graph/aad-advanced-queries).

>**Note:** The `$count` and `$search` query parameters are currently not available in Azure AD B2C tenants.
