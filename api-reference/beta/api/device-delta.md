# device: delta

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Get newly created, updated, or deleted devices without performing a full read of the entire resource collection. For more information, see [Use delta query to track changes in Microsoft Graph data](/graph/delta-query-overview) for details.

[!INCLUDE [national-cloud-support](../../includes/all-clouds.md)]

## Permissions

Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](/graph/permissions-reference).

## HTTP request
To begin tracking changes, you make a request including the delta function on the **device** resource. 

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
GET /devices/delta
```

## Query parameters

Tracking changes incurs a round of one or more **delta** function calls. To use any query parameter other than `$deltatoken` and `$skiptoken`, you must specify it in the initial **delta** request and Microsoft Graph automatically encodes any specified parameters into the `$deltatoken` portion of the `@odata.nextLink` or `@odata.deltaLink` URL provided in the response.

| Query parameter       | Type    |Description|
|:---------------|:--------|:----------|
| $deltatoken | string | A [state token](/graph/delta-query-overview) returned in the `@odata.deltaLink` URL of the previous **delta** function call for the same resource collection, indicating the completion of that round of change tracking. Save and apply the entire `@odata.deltaLink` URL including this token in the first request of the next round of change tracking for that collection.|
| $skiptoken | string | A [state token](/graph/delta-query-overview) returned in the `@odata.nextLink` URL of the previous **delta** function call, indicating that there are further changes to be tracked in the same resource collection. |

### Optional query parameters

This method supports OData query parameters to help customize the response.

- You can use the `$select` query parameter to specify only the properties your need for best performance. The **id** property is always returned.
- There is limited support for `$filter`. The only supported `$filter` expression is for tracking changes for specific resources, by their ID:  `$filter=id+eq+'{value}'` or `$filter=id+eq+'{value1}'+or+id+eq+'{value2}'`. The number of IDs you can specify is limited by the maximum URL length.


## Request headers
| Name       | Description|
|:---------------|:----------|
|Authorization|Bearer {token}. Required. Learn more about [authentication and authorization](/graph/auth/auth-concepts).|

## Request body
Don't supply a request body for this method.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and a collection of [device](../resources/device.md) objects in the response body. The response also includes a `@odata.nextLink` URL or a `@odata.deltaLink` URL.

- If a `@odata.nextLink` URL is returned, there are additional pages of data to be retrieved in the session. The device continues making requests using the `@odata.nextLink` URL until a `@odata.deltaLink` URL is included in the response.
- If a `@odata.deltaLink` URL is returned, there is no more data about the existing state of the resource to be returned. Persist and use the `@odata.deltaLink` URL to learn about changes to the resource in the future.

For more informantion, see [Using delta query](/graph/delta-query-overview). For example requests, see [Get incremental changes for users](/graph/delta-query-users).
