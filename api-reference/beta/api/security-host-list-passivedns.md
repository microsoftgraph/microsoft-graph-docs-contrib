| Name     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| :------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| $count   | `$count` is supported to return a holistic count of the number of [passiveDnsRecord](../resources/security-passivednsrecord.md) objects. `$count` is supported as a query parameter (`?$count=true`) or as a path parameter (`/$count`). |
| $orderby | `$orderby` supports some properties of the **passiveDns** resource. For more information, see [Supported properties with $orderby](#supported-properties-with-orderby).                                                                |
| $filter  | `$filter` is **required** in the request URL of this API. The API currently only supports filtering by one field in a call. For more information, see [Supported properties with $filter](#supported-properties-with-filter).           |
| $select  | `$select` is supported to limit the properties returned in this query.                                                                                                                                                         |
| $skip    | `$skip` is supported to skip over elements in pages. Combine with `$top` to perform pagination or use the `@odata.nextLink` for server-side pagination.                                                                        |
| $top     | `$top` is supported to limit the number of elements per page. Combine with `$skip` to perform pagination or use the `@odata.nextLink` for server-side pagination.                                                              |
