# message: replyAll

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Reply to all recipients of a message by specifying a comment and modifying any updateable properties 
for the reply, all by using the **replyAll** method. The message is then saved in the Sent Items folder.

Alternatively, you can first [create a draft reply-all message](../api/message-createreplyall.md) to include a comment or 
update any message properties, and then [send](../api/message-send.md) the reply.

**Note**

- You can specify either a comment or the **body** property of the `message` parameter. Specifying both will return an HTTP 400 Bad Request error.
- If the **replyTo** property is specified in the original message, per Internet Message Format 
([RFC 2822](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc2822)), you should send the reply to the recipients in the  
**replyTo** and **toRecipients** properties, and not the recipients in the **from** and **toRecipients** properties.
