# Get workbookOperation

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Meaningless if this url is called independently. This request is part of all async requests for excel. This is used to retrieve the status of a [workbookOperation](../resources/workbookoperation.md) object.

Currently not all requests support async. Take Create session request as an example.

Issue an async [Create session](./workbook-createsession.md) request, follow the documentation and you may get status code `202 Accepted`, async operation starts from here and you can find the url this document required from the response header, from the **location** part.
