# List users

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Retrieve a list of [user](../resources/user.md) objects.

This operation returns by default only a subset of the more commonly used properties for each user. These _default_ properties are noted in the [Properties](../resources/user.md#properties) section. To get properties that are _not_ returned by default, do a [GET operation](user-get.md) for the user and specify the properties in a `$select` OData query option.

[!INCLUDE [national-cloud-support](../../includes/all-clouds.md)]

## Permissions

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).
<!-- { "blockType": "ignored"  } // Note: Removing this line will result in the permissions autogeneration tool overwriting the table. -->
|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) | User.ReadBasic.All, User.Read.All, User.ReadWrite.All, Directory.Read.All, Directory.ReadWrite.All |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported.    |
|Application | User.Read.All, User.ReadWrite.All, Directory.Read.All, Directory.ReadWrite.All |

Guest users cannot call this API. For more information about the permissions for member and guest users, see [What are the default user permissions in Microsoft Entra ID?](/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/users-default-permissions?context=graph/context#member-and-guest-users).

### Permissions for specific scenarios
- *User-Mail.ReadWrite.All* is the least privileged permission to read and write the **otherMails** property; also allows to read some identifier-related properties on the user object.
- *User-PasswordProfile.ReadWrite.All* is the least privileged permission to read and write password reset-related properties; also allows to read some identifier-related properties on the user object.
- *User-Phone.ReadWrite.All* is the least privileged permission to read and write the **businessPhones** and **mobilePhone** properties; also allows to read some identifier-related properties on the user object.
- *User.EnableDisableAccount.All* + *User.Read.All* is the least privileged combination of permissions to read and write the **accountEnabled** property.

## HTTP request

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
GET /users
```

## Optional query parameters

This method supports the `$count`, `$expand`, `$filter`, `$orderby`, `$search`, `$select`, and `$top` [OData query parameters](/graph/query-parameters) to help customize the response. `$skip` isn't supported. The default and maximum page sizes are 100 and 999 user objects respectively, except when you specify `$select=signInActivity` or `$filter=signInActivity`. When `signInActivity` is selected or filtered on, the maximum page size is 500. Some queries are supported only when you use the **ConsistencyLevel** header set to `eventual` and `$count`. For more information, see [Advanced query capabilities on directory objects](/graph/aad-advanced-queries). The `$count` and `$search` parameters are currently not available in Azure AD B2C tenants.


Extension properties also support query parameters as follows:

| Extension type                     | Comments                                                                                  |
|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| onPremisesExtensionAttributes 1-15 | Returned only with `$select`. Supports `$filter` (`eq`, `ne`, and `eq` on `null` values). |
| Schema extensions                  | Returned only with `$select`. Supports `$filter` (`eq`, `ne`, and `eq` on `null` values). |
| Open extensions                    | Returned only with `$expand`, that is, `users?$expand=extensions`.                        |
| Directory extensions               | Returned only with `$select`. Supports `$filter` (`eq`, `ne`, and `eq` on `null` values). |

Certain properties cannot be returned within a user collection. The following properties are only supported when [retrieving a single user](./user-get.md): **aboutMe**, **birthday**, **hireDate**, **interests**, **mySite**, **pastProjects**, **preferredName**, **responsibilities**, **schools**, **skills**, **mailboxSettings**.

The following properties are not supported in personal Microsoft accounts and will be `null`: **aboutMe**, **birthday**, **interests**, **mySite**, **pastProjects**, **preferredName**, **responsibilities**, **schools**, **skills**, **streetAddress**.

## Request headers

| Header | Value |
|:------ |:----- |
|Authorization|Bearer {token}. Required. Learn more about [authentication and authorization](/graph/auth/auth-concepts).|
| ConsistencyLevel | eventual. This header and `$count` are required when using `$search`, or in specific usage of `$filter`. For more information about the use of **ConsistencyLevel** and `$count`, see [Advanced query capabilities on directory objects](/graph/aad-advanced-queries). |

## Request body

Don't supply a request body for this method.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and collection of [user](../resources/user.md) objects in the response body.

Attempting to use `$select` on the `/users` collection to retrieve properties that cannot be returned within a user collection (for example, the request `../users?$select=aboutMe`) returns a `501 Not Implemented` error code.

### Example 3: Get guest (B2B) users from a specific tenant or domain by userPrincipalName

#### Request

The following example shows a request. The userPrincipalName value for guest (B2B collaboration) users always contains the "#EXT#" identifier. For example, the userPrincipalName of a user in their home tenant is *AdeleV@adatum.com*. When you invite the user to collaborate in your tenant, *contoso.com*, their userPrincipalName in your tenant is "AdeleV_adatum.com#EXT#@contoso.com".

This request requires the **ConsistencyLevel** header set to `eventual` and the `$count=true` query string because the request includes the endsWith operator. For more information about the use of **ConsistencyLevel** and `$count`, see [Advanced query capabilities on directory objects](/graph/aad-advanced-queries).

>**NOTE:** You must encode the reserved character "#" in the userPrincipalName value as "%23" in the request URL. For more information, see [Encoding special characters](/graph/query-parameters#encoding-query-parameters).

### Example 4: List the last sign-in time of users with a specific display name

#### Request

The following example shows a request. 

> [!Note]
> * Details for the **signInActivity** property require a Microsoft Entra ID P1 or P2 license and the `AuditLog.Read.All` permission.
> * When you specify `$select=signInActivity` or `$filter=signInActivity` when listing users, the maximum page size for `$top` is 500. Requests with `$top` set higher than 500 return pages with up to 500 users. The **signInActivity** property supports `$filter` (`eq`, `ne`, `not`, `ge`, `le`) *but* not with any other filterable properties.

### Example 8: Use $filter to get all users with a mail that ends with 'a@contoso.com', including a count of returned objects, with the results ordered by userPrincipalName

#### Request

The following example shows a request. This request requires the **ConsistencyLevel** header set to `eventual` and the `$count=true` query string because the request has both the `$orderby` and `$filter` query parameters, and also uses the `endsWith` operator. For more information about the use of **ConsistencyLevel** and `$count`, see [Advanced query capabilities on directory objects](/graph/aad-advanced-queries).

>**Note:** The `$count` and `$search` query parameters are currently not available in Azure AD B2C tenants.

#### Response

In the following response, the schema extension property `ext55gb1l09_msLearnCourses` is unassigned in two of the user objects.
<!-- {
  "blockType": "response",
  "truncated": true,
  "@odata.type": "microsoft.graph.user"
} -->
```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-type: application/json

{
    "@odata.context": "https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/$metadata#users(ext55gb1l09_msLearnCourses)",
    "value": [
        {},
        {
            "ext55gb1l09_msLearnCourses": {
                "@odata.type": "#microsoft.graph.ComplexExtensionValue",

            }
        },
        {}
    ]
}
```

> **Note:** You can also apply `$filter` on the schema extension property to retrieve objects where a property in the collection matches a specified value. The syntax is `/users?$filter={schemaPropertyID}/{propertyName} eq 'value'`. For example, `GET /users?$select=ext55gb1l09_msLearnCourses&$filter=ext55gb1l09_msLearnCourses/courseType eq 'Developer'`. The `eq` and `not` operators are supported.

### Example 13: List all users with a custom security attribute assignment that equals a value

The following example shows how to list all users with a custom security attribute assignment that equals a value. The example retrieves users with a custom security attribute named `AppCountry` with a value that equals `Canada`. The filter value is case sensitive. You must add `ConsistencyLevel=eventual` in the request or the header. You must also include `$count=true` to ensure the request is routed correctly.

User #1

- Attribute set: `Marketing`
- Attribute: `AppCountry`
- Attribute data type: Collection of Strings
- Attribute value: `["India","Canada"]`

User #2

- Attribute set: `Marketing`
- Attribute: `AppCountry`
- Attribute data type: Collection of Strings
- Attribute value: `["Canada","Mexico"]`

To get custom security attribute assignments, the calling principal must be assigned the Attribute Assignment Reader or Attribute Assignment Administrator role and must be granted the *CustomSecAttributeAssignment.Read.All* or *CustomSecAttributeAssignment.ReadWrite.All* permission.

For examples of custom security attribute assignments, see [Examples: Assign, update, list, or remove custom security attribute assignments using the Microsoft Graph API](/graph/custom-security-attributes-examples).
