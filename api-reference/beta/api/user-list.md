# List users

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Retrieve a list of [user](../resources/user.md) objects.

This operation returns by default only a subset of the more commonly used properties for each user. These _default_ properties are noted in the [Properties](../resources/user.md#properties) section. To get properties that are _not_ returned by default, do a [GET operation](user-get.md) for the user and specify the properties in a `$select` OData query option.

## Permissions

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) | User.ReadBasic.All, User.Read.All, User.ReadWrite.All, Directory.Read.All, Directory.ReadWrite.All |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported.    |
|Application | User.Read.All, User.ReadWrite.All, Directory.Read.All, Directory.ReadWrite.All |

Guest users cannot call this API. For more information about the permissions for member and guest users, see [What are the default user permissions in Azure Active Directory?](/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/users-default-permissions#member-and-guest-users)

## HTTP request

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
GET /users
```

## Optional query parameters

This method supports the `$count`, `$expand`, `$filter`, `$orderBy`, `$search`, `$select`, and `$top` [OData query parameters](/graph/query-parameters) to help customize the response. `$skip` isn't supported. The default and maximum page sizes are 100 and 999 user objects respectively. Some queries are supported only when you use the **ConsistencyLevel** header set to `eventual` and `$count`. For more information, see [Advanced query capabilities on Azure AD directory objects](/graph/aad-advanced-queries). The `$count` and `$search` parameters are currently not available in Azure AD B2C tenants.

Extension properties also support query parameters as follows:

| Extension type                     | Comments                                                                                  |
|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| onPremisesExtensionAttributes 1-15 | Returned only with `$select`. Supports `$filter` (`eq`, `ne`, and `eq` on `null` values). |
| Schema extensions                  | Returned only with `$select`. Supports `$filter` (`eq`, `ne`, and `eq` on `null` values). |
| Open extensions                    | Returned only with `$expand`, that is, `users?$expand=extensions`.                        |
| Directory extensions               | Returned only with `$select`. Supports `$filter` (`eq`, `ne`, and `eq` on `null` values). |

Certain properties cannot be returned within a user collection. The following properties are only supported when [retrieving a single user](./user-get.md): **aboutMe**, **birthday**, **hireDate**, **interests**, **mySite**, **pastProjects**, **preferredName**, **responsibilities**, **schools**, **skills**, **mailboxSettings**.

The following properties are not supported in personal Microsoft accounts and will be `null`: **aboutMe**, **birthday**, **interests**, **mySite**, **pastProjects**, **preferredName**, **responsibilities**, **schools**, **skills**, **streetAddress**.

## Request headers

| Header | Value |
|:------ |:----- |
| Authorization | Bearer {token} (required)  |
| ConsistencyLevel | eventual. This header and `$count` are required when using `$search`, or in specific usage of `$filter`. For more information about the use of **ConsistencyLevel** and `$count`, see [Advanced query capabilities on Azure AD directory objects](/graph/aad-advanced-queries). |

## Request body

Do not supply a request body for this method.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and collection of [user](../resources/user.md) objects in the response body.

Attempting to use `$select` on the `/users` collection to retrieve properties that cannot be returned within a user collection (for example, the request `../users?$select=aboutMe`) returns a `501 Not Implemented` error code.

### Example 6: Get only a count of users

#### Request

The following is an example of the request. This request requires the **ConsistencyLevel** header set to `eventual` because `$count` is in the request. For more information about the use of **ConsistencyLevel** and `$count`, see [Advanced query capabilities on Azure AD directory objects](/graph/aad-advanced-queries).

>**Note:** The `$count` and `$search` query parameters are currently not available in Azure AD B2C tenants.

893
```

### Example 7: Use $filter and $top to get one user with a display name that starts with 'a' including a count of returned objects

#### Request

The following is an example of the request. This request requires the **ConsistencyLevel** header set to `eventual` and the `$count=true` query string because the request has both the `$orderBy` and `$filter` query parameters. For more information about the use of **ConsistencyLevel** and `$count`, see [Advanced query capabilities on Azure AD directory objects](/graph/aad-advanced-queries).

>**Note:** The `$count` and `$search` query parameters are currently not available in Azure AD B2C tenants.

      "userPrincipalName":"a_contoso.com#EXT#@microsoft.onmicrosoft.com"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Example 8: Use $filter to get all users with a mail that ends with 'a@contoso.com', including a count of returned objects, with the results ordered by userPrincipalName

#### Request

The following is an example of the request. This request requires the **ConsistencyLevel** header set to `eventual` and the `$count=true` query string because the request has both the `$orderBy` and `$filter` query parameters, and also uses the `endsWith` operator. For more information about the use of **ConsistencyLevel** and `$count`, see [Advanced query capabilities on Azure AD directory objects](/graph/aad-advanced-queries).

>**Note:** The `$count` and `$search` query parameters are currently not available in Azure AD B2C tenants.

### Example 9: Use $search to get users with display names that contain the letters 'wa' including a count of returned objects

### Example 10: Use $search to get users with display names that contain the letters 'wa' or the letters 'ad' including a count of returned objects

#### Request

The following is an example of the request. This request requires the **ConsistencyLevel** header set to `eventual` because `$search` is in the request. For more information about the use of **ConsistencyLevel** and `$count`, see [Advanced query capabilities on Azure AD directory objects](/graph/aad-advanced-queries).

>**Note:** The `$count` and `$search` query parameters are currently not available in Azure AD B2C tenants.

#### Response

In the following response, the schema extension property `ext55gb1l09_msLearnCourses` is unassigned in two of the user objects.
<!-- {
  "blockType": "response",
  "truncated": true,
  "@odata.type": "microsoft.graph.user"
} -->
```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-type: application/json

{
    "@odata.context": "https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/$metadata#users(ext55gb1l09_msLearnCourses)",
    "value": [
        {},
        {
            "ext55gb1l09_msLearnCourses": {
                "@odata.type": "#microsoft.graph.ComplexExtensionValue",
                "courseType": "Developer",
                "courseName": "Introduction to Microsoft Graph",
                "courseId": 1
            }
        },
        {}
    ]
}
```

> **Note:** You can also apply `$filter` on the schema extension property to retrieve objects where a property in the collection matches a specified value. The syntax is `/users?$filter={schemaPropertyID}/{propertyName} eq 'value'`. For example, `GET /users?$select=ext55gb1l09_msLearnCourses&$filter=ext55gb1l09_msLearnCourses/courseType eq 'Developer'`. The `eq` and `not` operators are supported.
