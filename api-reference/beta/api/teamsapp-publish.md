# Publish teamsApp

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Publish an [app](../resources/teamsapp.md) to the Microsoft Teams app catalog.
Specifically, this API publishes the app to your organization's catalog (the tenant app catalog);
the created resource has a **distributionMethod** property value of `organization`.

The **requiresReview** property allows any user to submit an app for review by an administrator. Admins can approve or reject these apps via this API or the Microsoft Teams admin center.

[!INCLUDE [national-cloud-support](../../includes/global-us.md)]

## Permissions

Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](/graph/permissions-reference).

<!-- { "blockType": "permissions", "name": "teamsapp_publish" } -->
[!INCLUDE [permissions-table](../includes/permissions/teamsapp-publish-permissions.md)]

> [!NOTE]
>
> * The `Directory.ReadWrite.All` permission is supported only for backward compatibility. We recommend that you update your solutions to use an alternative permission listed in the previous table and avoid using these permissions going forward.
> * The `AppCatalog.Submit` permission allows you to submit apps for review only, not to publish them to the catalog.

## HTTP request

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->

```http
POST /appCatalogs/teamsApps
```

To publish an app that requires a review:

```http
POST /appCatalogs/teamsApps?requiresReview={Boolean}
```

## Query parameters

|Property|Type|Description|
|----|----|----|
|requiresReview| Boolean | This optional query parameter triggers the app review process. Users with admin privileges can submit apps without triggering a review. If users want to request a review before publishing, they must set **requiresReview** to `true`. A user who has admin privileges can opt not to set **requiresReview** or set the value to `false`  and the app is approved and immediately published.|

## Request headers

| Header        | Value           |
|:--------------|:--------------  |
|Authorization|Bearer {token}. Required. Learn more about [authentication and authorization](/graph/auth/auth-concepts).|
| Content-Type  | application/zip. Required. |

## Request body

In the request body, include a Teams zip manifest payload. For details, see [Create an app package](/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/apps/apps-package).  

Each app in the app catalog must have a unique manifest ID.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and a [teamsApp](../resources/teamsapp.md) object. If the app manifest has any validation errors, the request returns an error response with details about the schema errors.

### Error response

If you send a request to upload an app manifest that contains missing information or errors, you receive an error message that includes the inner error code `UnableToParseTeamsAppManifest`. The **details** property of the inner error contains the error code and the error message. The following table describes the error codes that you might encounter.
