# call: reject

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Enable a bot to reject an incoming [call](../resources/call.md). The incoming call request can be an invite to a meeting or a peer to peer call. For a meeting invite, the notification contains the `chatInfo` and `meetingInfo` parameters.

When the bot is registered with a valid callback URL in the Azure portal, the incoming call is delivered as a [commsNotification](../resources/commsnotification.md) with `changeType` set to `created`. The bot is expected to `Answer` or `Reject` the call before it times out.

> [!NOTE]
> Bots can only be reached by VOIP. PSTN calling to bots is not yet supported.

This API is only used to reject incoming calls. To end existing calls, use [Delete call](../api/call-delete.md).
