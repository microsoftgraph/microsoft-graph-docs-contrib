### Example 2: List folders with query parameters

The following example uses the `$filter`, `$select`, and `$top` query parameters. The `$filter` parameter refines the results and returns only folders of **type** `IPF.Appointment`. The `$select` parameter is specified to return only the **displayName** and **type** properties, and the `$top` parameter sets the page size of the result set to return the first five folders in the mailbox.
