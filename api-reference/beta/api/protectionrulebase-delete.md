# Delete protectionRuleBase

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Delete a [protection rule](../resources/protectionrulebase.md) from a [protection policy](../resources/protectionpolicybase.md).

You can delete a rule when the state is `completed` or `completedWithErrors`. Deleting a [protection rule](../resources/protectionRuleBase.md) doesn't remove the corresponding [protection units](../resources/protectionunitbase.md) from the [protection policy](../resources/protectionpolicybase.md).

## Permissions

Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](/graph/permissions-reference).
