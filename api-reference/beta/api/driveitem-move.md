# driveItem: move
Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Move a [driveItem](../resources/driveitem.md) to a new parent.

To move a **driveItem** to a new parent item, your app requests an update to the **parentReference** of the **driveItem** to move. The move is a special type of [Update](driveitem-update.md) operation.
Your app can combine moving an item to a new container and updating other properties of the item into a single request.

When a **driveItem** is moved within the same site or container, all existing sharing links continue to work. If the **driveItem** is moved to a different site or container, existing sharing links no longer work.

## Permissions
Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](/graph/permissions-reference).

## Request headers

| Name          | Type   | Description                                                                                                                                                         |
|:--------------|:-------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|Authorization  |Bearer {token}. Required. Learn more about [authentication and authorization](/graph/auth/auth-concepts).|
| if-match      | String | If this request header is included and the eTag (or cTag) provided doesn't match the current eTag on the folder, a `412 Precondition Failed` response is returned. Optional.|

## Request body

In the request body, supply the new value for the **parentReference** property.
Existing properties that aren't included in the request body maintain their previous values or the properties are recalculated based on changes to other property values.
For optimal performance, include only the values that change and omit the unchanged ones.

> [!NOTE]
> When items are moved to the root of a drive, your application must use the actual ID of the root folder as the parent reference instead of the `"id: root"` syntax.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and an updated [driveItem](../resources/driveitem.md) resource in the response body.

For information about how errors are returned, see [Error responses][error-response].
