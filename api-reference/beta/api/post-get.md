# Get post

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Get the properties and relationships of a post in a specified thread. You can specify both the parent
conversation and the thread, or, you can specify the thread without referencing the parent conversation.

Since the **post** resource supports [extensions](/graph/extensibility-overview), you can also use the `GET` operation to get custom properties and extension data in a **post** instance.
