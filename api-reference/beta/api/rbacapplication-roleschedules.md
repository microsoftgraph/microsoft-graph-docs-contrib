The scope of an assignment determines the set of resources for which the principal has been granted access. App scopes are scopes that are defined and understood by this application only. Use `/` for tenant-wide app scopes. Use **directoryScopeId** to limit the scope to particular directory objects, for example, administrative units. |
|principalId|String| Identifier of the principal to which the assignment is being granted to. Can be a group or a user. |
|roleDefinitionId|String|Identifier of the unifiedRoleDefinition for the assignment. Read only.|
