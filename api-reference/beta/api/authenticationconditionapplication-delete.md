# Delete authenticationConditionApplication (from a user flow)
Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Remove or unlink [an application](../resources/authenticationconditionapplication.md) from an external identities self-service sign-up user flow that's represented by an [externalUsersSelfServiceSignupEventsFlow](../resources/externalusersselfservicesignupeventsflow.md) object. This disables the authentication experience that's defined by the user flow for the application.
