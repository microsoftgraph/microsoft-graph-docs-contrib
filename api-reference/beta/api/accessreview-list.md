# List accessReviews (deprecated)

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

[!INCLUDE [accessreviews-disclaimer](../../includes/accessreviews-disclaimer.md)]

Retrieve the [accessReview](../resources/accessreview.md) objects for a particular [businessFlowTemplate](../resources/businessflowtemplate.md). A list of zero or more **accessReview** objects are returned, for each one-time and recurring access review that was created with that business flow template.  Business flow template IDs are case sensitive.

>[!NOTE]
> If any of the access reviews that match the filter is a recurring access review, one **accessReview** object will be returned to represent each recurring series as a whole, in addition to any current, past and the next upcoming instance. For example, if there is a monthly recurring access review of guest members of group A, a quarterly recurring access review of guest members of group B, and a one-time access review of guest members of group C, each of these recurrences have just started, and the caller queries for access reviews with a business flow template of reviews of guest members of groups, three objects will be returned representing the three series, as well as three objects for the current access review instances, and potentially three objects for the next upcoming instances. To retrieve the instances of a recurring access review, or the access review instance scheduled for a particular month or quarter, the caller can subsequently navigate the **instance** relationship of the recurring **accessReview** object. The **instance** relationship links to the **accessReview** objects for a current or the past instances of the recurring access review.

If many access reviews match the filter, to improve efficiency and avoid timeouts, retrieve the result set in pages, by including both the `$top` query parameter with a page size, for example 100, and the `$skip=0` query parameter in the request. These parameters can be included even when you don't anticipate that the request spans multiple pages. When a result set spans multiple pages, Microsoft Graph returns that page with an `@odata.nextLink` property in the response that contains a URL to the next page of results. If that property is present, continue making requests with the `@odata.nextLink` URL in each response, until all the results are returned, as described in [paging Microsoft Graph data in your app](/graph/paging).

The **accessReview** objects returned by this API don't include nested structure properties such as **settings**, or relationships.  To retrieve an access review settings or relationships, use the [get accessReview](accessreview-get.md) API.
