# Get incident
Namespace: microsoft.graph.security

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Retrieve the properties and relationships of an [incident](../resources/security-incident.md) object.

Attacks are typically inflicted on different types of entities, such as devices, users, and mailboxes, resulting in multiple [alert](../resources/security-alert.md) objects. Microsoft 365 Defender correlates alerts with the same attack techniques or the same attacker into an **incident**.
