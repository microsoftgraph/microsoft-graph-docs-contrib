# Update profilephoto

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Update the photo for any user in the tenant including the signed-in user, or the specified group or contact. Since there
is currently a limit of 8MB on the total size of each REST request, this limits the size of the photo
you can add to under 8MB.

Use only PUT for this operation in the beta version.

> **Note**:  When updating the **user** photo, this operation first attempts to update the photo in Microsoft 365. If that fails (due to the user not having a mailbox), this API will attempt to update the photo in Azure Active Directory.

## Permissions
One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account)     | Profile photo of the signed-in **user**:<br/>User.ReadWrite, User.ReadWrite.All<br /><br />For **group** resource:<br />Group.ReadWrite.All<br /><br />For **contact** resource:<br />Contacts.ReadWrite |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported. |
|Application                            | For **user** resource:<br/>User.ReadWrite.All<br /><br />For **group** resource:<br />Group.ReadWrite.All<br /><br />For **contact** resource:<br />Contacts.ReadWrite |

> **Note** To update the photo of any user in the organization, your app must have the User.ReadWrite.All application permission and call this API under its own identity, not on behalf of a user. To learn more, see [get access without a signed-in user](/graph/auth-v2-service). Updating the photo of the signed-in user only requires User.ReadWrite permission.

> **Note:**  There is currently a [known issue](/graph/known-issues#groups) with accessing group photos using application permissions.
