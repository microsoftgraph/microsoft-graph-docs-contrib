# Update profilephoto

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Update the photo for any user in the tenant, including the signed-in user or the specified group or contact. Because there
is currently a limit of 8MB on the total size of each REST request, the size of the photo you can add is limited to under 8MB.

Only use PUT for this operation.

> **Note**:  When updating the **user** photo, this operation first attempts to update the photo in Microsoft 365. If that fails (due to the user not having a mailbox), this API will attempt to update the photo in Azure Active Directory.

## Permissions
One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account)     | Profile photo of the signed-in **user**:<br/>User.ReadWrite, User.ReadWrite.All<br /><br />For **group** resource:<br />Group.ReadWrite.All<br /><br />For **contact** resource:<br />Contacts.ReadWrite |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported. |
|Application                            | For **user** resource:<br/>User.ReadWrite.All<br /><br />For **group** resource:<br />Group.ReadWrite.All<br /><br />For **contact** resource:<br />Contacts.ReadWrite |

> **Note** To update the photo of any user in the organization, your app must have the User.ReadWrite.All application permission and call this API under its own identity, not on behalf of a user. To learn more, see [get access without a signed-in user](/graph/auth-v2-service). Updating the photo of the signed-in user only requires User.ReadWrite permission.

> **Note:**  There is currently a [known issue](/graph/known-issues#groups) with accessing group photos using application permissions.
