# List agentUser direct memberships

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Get [groups](../resources/group.md), [directory roles](../resources/directoryrole.md), and [administrative units](../resources/administrativeunit.md) that the [agentUser](../resources/agentuser.md) is a direct member of. This operation isn't transitive.

## Permissions

Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](/graph/permissions-reference).

|Permission type      | Least privileged permission | Higher privileged permissions |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------|:-----------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) | User.Read.All | AgentIdUser.ReadWrite.IdentityParentedBy, AgentIdUser.ReadWrite.All, User.ReadWrite.All |

## HTTP request

<!-- {
  "blockType": "ignored"
}
-->
``` http
GET /users/{usersId}/memberOf
```

## Optional query parameters

This method supports the [OData query parameters](/graph/query-parameters) to help customize the response, including `$search`, `$count`, and `$filter`. OData cast is also enabled; for example, you can cast to get just the **directoryRoles** the user is a member of. You can use `$search` on the **displayName** property. Items that are added or updated for this resource are specially indexed for use with the `$count` and `$search` query parameters. There can be a slight delay between when an item is added or updated and when it's available in the index.

The use of `$filter` with this API requires the **ConsistencyLevel** header set to `eventual` and `$count`. However, in such scenarios, you can't use `$expand` in the same request as it isn't supported with advanced query parameters. For more information, see [Advanced query capabilities on directory objects](/graph/aad-advanced-queries).

## Request headers

|Name|Description|

|Authorization|Bearer {token}. Required. Learn more about [authentication and authorization](/graph/auth/auth-concepts).|

## Request body

Don't supply a request body for this method.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and a collection of [directoryObject](../resources/directoryobject.md) objects in the response body.
