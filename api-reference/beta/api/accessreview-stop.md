In the Microsoft Entra [access reviews](../resources/accessreviews-root.md) feature, stop a currently active [accessReview](../resources/accessreview.md).  The target object can be either a one-time access review, or an instance of a recurring access review.

After the access review stops, reviewers can no longer give input, and the access review decisions can be applied.
