# Remove owner

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Remove an owner from an [application](../resources/application.md). As a recommended best practice, apps should have at least two owners.

[!INCLUDE [national-cloud-support](../../includes/all-clouds.md)]

## Permissions
Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](/graph/permissions-reference).

[!INCLUDE [permissions-table](../includes/permissions/application-delete-owners-permissions.md)]

> [!IMPORTANT]
> 
> In delegated scenarios with work or school accounts, the signed-in user must be assigned a supported [Microsoft Entra role](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference?toc=%2Fgraph%2Ftoc.json) or a custom role with a supported role permission. The following least privileged roles are supported for this operation.
> - Hybrid Identity Administrator
> - Cloud Application Administrator
> - Application Administrator

## HTTP request

You can address the application using either its **id** or **appId**. **id** and **appId** are referred to as the **Object ID** and **Application (Client) ID**, respectively, in app registrations in the Microsoft Entra admin center.
<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
DELETE /applications/{id}/owners/{id}/$ref
DELETE /applications(appId='{appId}')/owners/{id}/$ref
```

> [!CAUTION]
> If `/$ref` is not appended to the request and the calling app has permissions to manage the user who is the app owner, the user will also be deleted from Microsoft Entra ID; otherwise, a `403 Forbidden` error is returned. You can restore deleted users through the [Restore deleted items API](directory-deleteditems-restore.md).
