## Permissions

Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions).

[!INCLUDE [permissions-table](../includes/permissions/sharepointgroup-list-members-permissions.md)]

> [!NOTE]
> In addition to Microsoft Graph permissions, applications calling this API must at least have the `AddPermissions` container type-level permission on the container type of the corresponding containers. For more information, see [container types](/sharepoint/dev/embedded/concepts/app-concepts/containertypes). To learn more about container type-level permissions, see [SharePoint Embedded authorization](/sharepoint/dev/embedded/concepts/app-concepts/auth#authorization).

## HTTP request

## Optional query parameters

This method supports the `$count`, `$filter`, `$orderby`, `$skip`, and `$top` OData query parameters to help customize the response. For general information, see [OData query parameters](/graph/query-parameters). You can `$filter` or `$orderby` by the **id** and **displayName** properties.
