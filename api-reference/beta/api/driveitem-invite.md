# Send a sharing invitation

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Sends a sharing invitation for a **driveItem**.
A sharing invitation provides permissions to the recipients and optionally sends an email to the recipients to notify them the item was shared.

Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](/graph/permissions-reference).

The following example shows the response.

<!-- { "blockType": "response", "@odata.type": "Collection(microsoft.graph.permission)", "truncated": true } -->

    }
  ]
}
```
### Partial success response

When inviting multiple recipients, it's possible for the notification to succeed for some and fail for others.
In this case, the service returns a partial success response with an HTTP status code of 207.
When partial success is returned, the response for each failed recipient contains an `error` object with information about what went wrong and how to fix it.

The following example shows the partial response.

<!-- { "blockType": "response", "@odata.type": "Collection(microsoft.graph.permission)", "truncated": true } -->

```http

        "innererror":{
          "code":"accountVerificationRequired"
        }
      }
    },

          "displayName": "Robin Danielsen",
          "id": "42F177F1-22C0-4BE3-900D-4507125C5C20"
        }
      },
      "id": "CCFC7CA3-7A19-4D57-8CEF-149DB9DDFA62",
      "invitation": {
        "email": "robin@contoso.com",

### SendNotification errors
The following are some other errors that your app might encounter within the nested `innererror` objects when sending notification fails.
Apps aren't required to handle these errors.

* For a list of available roles, see [roles property values](../resources/permission.md#roles-property-values).
