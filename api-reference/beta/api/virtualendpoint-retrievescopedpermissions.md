## HTTP request

<!-- {
  "blockType": "ignored"
}
-->

``` http
GET /deviceManagement/virtualEndpoint/retrieveScopedPermissions
```

## Request headers

| Name          | Description               |
| :------------ | :------------------------ |

## Request body

Don't supply a request body for this method.

## Response

If successful, this function returns a `200 OK` response code and a collection of [cloudPcScopedPermission](../resources/cloudpcscopedpermission.md) objects in the response body.
This API supports filter with permission, when no filter, this function returns all permissions and scope Tag IDs of the authenticated user.

## Optional query parameters
This method supports the $filter OData query parameter to customize the response. If the $filter parameter is not included, the function returns all permissions and scope IDs of the authenticated user.

## Examples

### Example 1: Get all the permissions and scope IDs of the authenticated user
The following example shows a request without the `$filter` query to get the permissions and scope IDs of the authenticated user.

> **Note:** The response object shown here might be shortened for readability.
<!-- {
  "blockType": "response",
  "truncated": true,
  "@odata.type": "Collection(Edm.String)"
}
-->

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "@odata.context": "https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/$metadata#Collection(microsoft.graph.cloudPcScopedPermission)",
    "@odata.count": 2,
    "value": [
        {
            "permission": "Microsoft.CloudPC/ProvisioningPolicies/Update",
            "scopeIds": ["1","2"]
        },

            "scopeIds": ["1"]
        }
    ]
}
```

### Example 3: No scope IDs are returned

#### Request

When the signed-in user has an admin role such as the Intune admin or the Windows 365 admin role assigned by Microsoft Entra ID, the returned permission is *\**, and no scope IDs are returned. In these cases, queries aren't supported.
