# driveItem: discardCheckout

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]


Discard the check out of a [driveItem](../resources/driveitem.md). This action releases a **driveItem** resource that was previously [checked out](driveitem-checkout.md). Any changes made to the item while it was checked out are discarded. 

The same user that performed the checkout must discard it. Another alternative is to use application permissions.
