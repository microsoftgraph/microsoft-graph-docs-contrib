# directoryObject: getMemberGroups

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Return all the group IDs for the groups that the specified [user](../resources/user.md), [group](../resources/group.md), [service principal](../resources/serviceprincipal.md), [organizational contact](../resources/orgcontact.md), [device](../resources/device.md), or [directory object](../resources/directoryobject.md) is a member of. This function is transitive.

This API returns up to 11,000 group IDs. If more than 11,000 results are available, it returns a `400 Bad Request` error with the `Directory_ResultSizeLimitExceeded` error code. If you get the `Directory_ResultSizeLimitExceeded` error code, use the [List group transitive memberOf](../api/group-list-transitivememberof.md) API instead.

## Permissions
One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

### Group memberships for a directory object

Here, the permission allows you to read *any* directory object, regardless of the object type. To scope the operation to a specific object type and use lesser-privileged permissions, refer to other permissions tables on this page.

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored"  } // Note: Removing this line will result in the permissions autogeneration tool overwriting the table. -->
|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
