# Activate directoryRole

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Activate a directory role. To read a directory role or update its members, it must first be activated in the tenant.

The Company Administrators and the implicit user directory roles (**User**, **Guest User**, and **Restricted Guest User** roles) are activated by default. To access and assign members to other directory roles, you must first activate it with its corresponding [directory role template](../resources/directoryroletemplate.md) ID.
