# Activate directoryRole

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Activate a directory role. To read a directory role or update its members, it must first be activated in the tenant. Only the Company Administrators  and the implicit Users directory roles are activated by default. To access and assign members to another directory role, you must first activate it with its corresponding directory role template ([directoryRoleTemplate](../resources/directoryroletemplate.md)).
