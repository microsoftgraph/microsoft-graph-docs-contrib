# List accessPackageAssignmentRequests

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

In [Azure AD entitlement management](../resources/entitlementmanagement-root.md), retrieve a list of [accessPackageAssignmentRequest](../resources/accesspackageassignmentrequest.md) objects.  The resulting list includes all the assignment requests, current and well as expired, that the caller has access to read, across all catalogs and access packages.

## HTTP request

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->

```http
GET /identityGovernance/entitlementManagement/accessPackageAssignmentRequests

## Optional query parameters

This method supports the `$expand` and `$filter` OData query parameters to help customize the response. For example, to retrieve the access package of each request, include `$expand=accessPackage` in the query.  To retrieve only requests for a specific access package, include in the query a filter such as `$expand=accessPackage&$filter=accessPackage/id eq '9bbe5f7d-f1e7-4eb1-a586-38cdf6f8b1ea'`.  To retrieve the resulting assignment, include `$expand=accessPackageAssignment` in the query.  To obtain more details on the requestor, include `$expand=requestor` in the query.
For general information, see [OData query parameters](/graph/query-parameters).
