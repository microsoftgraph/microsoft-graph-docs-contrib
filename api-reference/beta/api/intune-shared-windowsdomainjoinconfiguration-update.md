## Request body
In the request body, supply a JSON representation for the [windowsDomainJoinConfiguration](../resources/intune-shared-windowsdomainjoinconfiguration.md) object.

The following table shows the properties that are required when you create the [windowsDomainJoinConfiguration](../resources/intune-shared-windowsdomainjoinconfiguration.md).

|Property|Type|Description|
|:---|:---|:---|
|id|String|Key of the entity. Inherited from [deviceConfiguration](../resources/intune-shared-deviceconfiguration.md)|
|**Device configuration**|
|activeDirectoryDomainName|String|Active Directory domain name to join.|
|computerNameStaticPrefix|String|Fixed prefix to be used for computer name.|
|computerNameSuffixRandomCharCount|Int32|Dynamically generated characters used as suffix for computer name. Valid values 3 to 14|
|createdDateTime|DateTimeOffset|DateTime the object was created. Inherited from [deviceConfiguration](../resources/intune-shared-deviceconfiguration.md)|
|description|String|Admin provided description of the Device Configuration. Inherited from [deviceConfiguration](../resources/intune-shared-deviceconfiguration.md)|
|displayName|String|Admin provided name of the device configuration. Inherited from [deviceConfiguration](../resources/intune-shared-deviceconfiguration.md)|
|lastModifiedDateTime|DateTimeOffset|DateTime the object was last modified. Inherited from [deviceConfiguration](../resources/intune-shared-deviceconfiguration.md)|
|organizationalUnit|String|Organizational unit (OU) where the computer account will be created. If this parameter is NULL, the well known computer object container will be used as published in the domain.|
|roleScopeTagIds|String collection|List of Scope Tags for this Entity instance. Inherited from [deviceConfiguration](../resources/intune-shared-deviceconfiguration.md)|
|supportsScopeTags|Boolean|Indicates whether or not the underlying Device Configuration supports the assignment of scope tags. Assigning to the ScopeTags property is not allowed when this value is false and entities will not be visible to scoped users. This occurs for Legacy policies created in Silverlight and can be resolved by deleting and recreating the policy in the Azure Portal. This property is read-only. Inherited from [deviceConfiguration](../resources/intune-shared-deviceconfiguration.md)|
|version|Int32|Version of the device configuration. Inherited from [deviceConfiguration](../resources/intune-shared-deviceconfiguration.md)|
