# List recoveryKeys
Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Get a list of the [bitlockerRecoveryKey](../resources/bitlockerrecoverykey.md) objects and their properties. 

This operation does not return the **key** property. For information about how to read the **key** property, see [Get bitlockerRecoveryKey](bitlockerrecoverykey-get.md).

## Permissions
One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

|Permission type|Permissions (from most to least privileged)|
|:---|:---|
|Delegated (work or school account)|BitLocker.ReadBasic.All, BitLocker.Read.All|
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account)|Not supported|
|Application|Not supported|

>**Note**: For delegated permissions to allow apps to get BitLockerRecoveryKey resources on behalf of the signed-in user, the tenant administrator must have assigned the user one of the following roles, or the user must be the registered owner of the device that the BitLocker recovery key was originally backed up from: 
* Global administrator
* Cloud device administrator
* Helpdesk administrator
* Intune service administrator
* Security administrator
* Security reader
* Global reader

## HTTP request
To get a list of BitLocker keys within the tenant:

<!-- {
  "blockType": "ignored"
}
-->
``` http
GET /bitlocker/recoveryKeys
```

To get a list of BitLocker keys within the tenant filtered by the **device id**:

<!-- {
  "blockType": "ignored"
}
-->
``` http
GET /bitlocker/recoveryKeys?$filter=deviceId eq '{deviceId}'
```

## Optional query parameters
This method supports the `$filter` OData query parameter to filter results by the **device id** the key was most recently backed up to. For details, see [Example 2](#example-2). For general information, see [OData query parameters](/graph/query-parameters).

The response might also contain an `odata.nextLink`, which you can use to page through the result set. For details, see [Paging Microsoft Graph data](/graph/paging).
