# Create appRoleAssignment

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Assign an app role to a client agent identity.

App roles that are assigned to agent identities are also known as [application permissions](/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-permissions-and-consent#permission-types). Application permissions can be granted directly with app role assignments, or through a [consent experience](/azure/active-directory/develop/application-consent-experience).

To grant an app role assignment to a client agent identity, you need three identifiers:

- `principalId`: The `id` of the client agent identity to which you are assigning the app role.
- `resourceId`: The `id` of the resource `servicePrincipal` (the API) which has defined the app role (the application permission).
- `appRoleId`: The `id` of the `appRole` (defined on the resource service principal) to assign to the client agent identity.

[!INCLUDE [national-cloud-support](../../includes/all-clouds.md)]


## Permissions

Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](/graph/permissions-reference).

[!INCLUDE [permissions-table](../includes/permissions/agentidentity-post-approleassignments-permissions.md)]

## HTTP request

You can address the agent identity using either its **id** or **appId**. **id** and **appId** are referred to as the **Object ID** and **Application (Client) ID**, respectively, in app registrations in the Microsoft Entra admin center.
<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
POST /servicePrincipals/{id}/Microsoft.Graph.AgentIdentity/appRoleAssignments
POST /servicePrincipals(appId='{appId}')/Microsoft.Graph.AgentIdentity/appRoleAssignments

```

> [!NOTE]
> As a best practice, we recommend creating app role assignments through the [`appRoleAssignedTo` relationship of the _resource_ service principal](serviceprincipal-post-approleassignedto.md), instead of the `appRoleAssignments` relationship of the assigned user, group, or service principal.

## Request headers

|Name|Description|
|:---|:---|
|Authorization|Bearer {token}. Required. Learn more about [authentication and authorization](/graph/auth/auth-concepts).|
|Content-Type|application/json. Required.|

## Request body

In the request body, supply a JSON representation of the [appRoleAssignment](../resources/approleassignment.md) object.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `201 Created` response code and an [appRoleAssignment](../resources/approleassignment.md) object in the response body.

## Examples

### Request

The following example shows a request.


<!-- {
  "blockType": "request",
  "name": "serviceprincipal_create_approleassignment"
}-->

```http
POST https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/servicePrincipals/9028d19c-26a9-4809-8e3f-20ff73e2d75e/Microsoft.Graph.AgentIdentity/appRoleAssignments
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "principalId": "9028d19c-26a9-4809-8e3f-20ff73e2d75e",
  "resourceId": "8fce32da-1246-437b-99cd-76d1d4677bd5",
  "appRoleId": "498476ce-e0fe-48b0-b801-37ba7e2685c6"
}
```

In this example, note that the value used as the agent identity **id** in the request URL (`9028d19c-26a9-4809-8e3f-20ff73e2d75e`) is the same as the **principalId** property in the body. The **resourceId** value is the **id** of the resource service principal (the API).

### Response

The following example shows the response.
