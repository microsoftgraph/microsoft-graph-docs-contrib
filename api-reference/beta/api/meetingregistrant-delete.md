# Unenroll meeting registrant (deprecated)

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

> [!CAUTION]
> The meeting registrant API is deprecated and will stop returning data on **December 12, 2024**. Please use the new [webinar APIs](../resources/virtualeventwebinar.md). For more information, see [Deprecation of the Microsoft Graph meeting registration beta APIs](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/microsoft365dev/deprecation-of-the-microsoft-graph-meeting-registration-beta-apis/). 

Cancel an [onlineMeeting](../resources/onlinemeeting.md) registration for a [meetingRegistrant](../resources/meetingregistrant.md) on behalf of the registrant.

Only use this method when the **allowedRegistrant** property of the [meetingRegistration](../resources/meetingregistration.md) object has a value of `organization` and the registrant's delegated permission was used to enroll. When the **allowedRegistrant** value is `everyone`, registrants can only use the link in the email they receive to cancel their registration.

To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](/graph/permissions-reference).
