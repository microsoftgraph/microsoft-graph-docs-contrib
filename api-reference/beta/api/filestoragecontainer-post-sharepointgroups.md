# Create sharePointGroup

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Create a new [sharePointGroup](../resources/sharepointgroup.md) object. The **sharePointGroup** only exists within the scope of the [fileStorageContainer](../resources/filestoragecontainer.md) in which it was created. To add permissions for the **sharePointGroup** on [driveItem](../resources/driveitem.md) objects, you must use the [Create permission on a driveItem](./driveitem-post-permissions.md) API. Up to 10,000 **sharePointGroup** objects can be created per **fileStorageContainer**. For more information on service limits, see [SharePoint online limits](/office365/servicedescriptions/sharepoint-online-service-description/sharepoint-online-limits#sharepoint-groups).

[!INCLUDE [national-cloud-support](../../includes/global-only.md)]

## Permissions

Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](/graph/permissions-reference).

> In addition to Microsoft Graph permissions, applications calling this API must at least have the `AddPermissions` container type-level permission on the container type of the corresponding containers. For more information, see [container types](/sharepoint/dev/embedded/concepts/app-concepts/containertypes). To learn more about container type-level permissions, see [SharePoint Embedded authorization](/sharepoint/dev/embedded/concepts/app-concepts/auth#authorization).
