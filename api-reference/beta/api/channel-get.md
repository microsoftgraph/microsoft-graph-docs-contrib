## Permissions

Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](/graph/permissions-reference).

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) | Channel.ReadBasic.All, ChannelSettings.Read.All, ChannelSettings.ReadWrite.All, Group.Read.All\*\*, Group.ReadWrite.All\*\*, Directory.Read.All\*\*, Directory.ReadWrite.All\*\* |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported.    |
|Application | ChannelSettings.Read.Group\*, ChannelSettings.ReadWrite.Group\*, Channel.ReadBasic.All, ChannelSettings.Read.All, ChannelSettings.ReadWrite.All, Group.Read.All\*\*, Group.ReadWrite.All\*\*, Directory.Read.All\*\*, Directory.ReadWrite.All\*\* |
