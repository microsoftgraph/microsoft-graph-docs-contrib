# Update educationModule

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Update an [educationModule](../resources/educationmodule.md) object in a [class](../resources/educationclass.md).

Only teachers in the class can perform this operation. Note that you can't use a PATCH request to change the status of a module. Use the [publish](../api/educationmodule-publish.md) action to change the module status.
