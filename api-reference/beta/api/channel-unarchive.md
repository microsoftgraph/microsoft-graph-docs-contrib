# channel: unarchive

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Restore an archived [channel](../resources/channel.md). Unarchiving restores the ability for users to send messages and edit the channel. Channels are archived via the [channel: archive](channel-archive.md) method.

Unarchiving is an asynchronous operation; a channel is unarchived when the asynchronous unarchiving operation completes successfully, which might occur after this method responds.

> **Note**: An archived channel that belongs to an archived team cannot be unarchived. Unarchive the team before you unarchive the channel; otherwise, the request fails.
