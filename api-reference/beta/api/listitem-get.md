## Permissions

Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](/graph/permissions-reference).

> **Note**: The application permission Sites.Manage.All is required if the SharePoint list has content approval settings turned on. Otherwise, Microsoft Graph won't retrieve list items that have an approval status other than Approved.
