# List teamsApp

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

List [apps](../resources/teamsapp.md) from the Microsoft Teams app catalog.
This includes apps from the Microsoft Teams store, as well as apps from your organization's app catalog (the tenant app catalog). To get apps from your organization's app catalog only, specify `organization` as the **distributionMethod** in the request.

> [!NOTE]
> In general, the **id** of a **teamsApp** resource is generated by the server. It is not the same as the **id** specified in a Teams app manifest, unless its **distributionMethod** is `store`. For other cases, the **id** provided by the developer as part of the Teams app manifest is stamped as the **externalId** in the **teamsApp** resource.

[!INCLUDE [national-cloud-support](../../includes/global-us.md)]

## Permissions

Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](/graph/permissions-reference).

<!-- { "blockType": "permissions", "name": "appcatalogs_list_teamsapps" } -->
[!INCLUDE [permissions-table](../includes/permissions/appcatalogs-list-teamsapps-permissions.md)]

> **Note**:
The Directory.Read.All and Directory.ReadWrite.All permissions are supported only for backward compatibility. We recommend that you update your solutions to use an alternative permission and avoid using these permissions going forward.

## HTTP request

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->

```http
GET /appCatalogs/teamsApps
```

## Optional query parameters

This method supports the `$filter`, `$select`, and `$expand` [OData query parameters](/graph/query-parameters) to help customize the response.

Using `$expand=AppDefinitions` will return more information about the state of the app, such as the **publishingState**, which reflects the app submission review status and returns whether an app has been approved, rejected, or remains under review.

> **Note:** You can filter on any of the fields of the [teamsApp](../resources/teamsapp.md) object to shorten the list of results. You can use any of the following filter operations: Equal, not-equal, and, or, and not.

## Request headers

| Header        | Value                     |
|:--------------|:--------------------------|
|Authorization|Bearer {token}. Required. Learn more about [authentication and authorization](/graph/auth/auth-concepts).|

## Request body

Don't supply a request body for this method.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and a list of [teamsApp](../resources/teamsapp.md) objects in the response body.
