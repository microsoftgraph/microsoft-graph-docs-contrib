# Remove attribute (from user flow)
Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Remove an attribute from an external identities self-service sign up user flow that's represented by an [externalUsersSelfServiceSignupEventsFlow](../resources/externalusersselfservicesignupeventsflow.md) object. You can add both custom and built-in attributes to a user flow.

After this step, [PATCH the user flow](../api/authenticationeventsflow-update.md) to remove the attribute from the attribute collection step.
