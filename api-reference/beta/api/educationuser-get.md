# Get educationUser

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Retrieve the properties and relationships of a user.

## Permissions

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

> [!NOTE]
> If the delegated token is used, members can only see information about their own account. Use the `beta/education/me/users` resource in this case.

| Permission type                        | Permissions (from least to most privileged) |
| :------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------ |
| Delegated (work or school account)     | EduRoster.ReadBasic                         |
| Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported.                              |
| Application                            | EduRoster.Read.All, EduRoster.ReadWrite.All |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When using Delegated permission scopes, Graph will only return a limited set of properties: `id`, `primaryRole`, `accountEnabled`, `displayName`, `givenName`, `surname`, `userPrincipalName`, `userType`, `onPremisesInfo`, `student/externalId`, `teacher/externalId`. If your application requires additional properties, you must use Application permission scopes.
