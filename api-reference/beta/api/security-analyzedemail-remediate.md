Remove a potential threat from end users' mailboxes.

Remediation means to take prescribed action against a threat. This API can trigger email purge actions like move to junk, move to deleted items, soft delete, hard delete, or move to Inbox. This API enables scenarios and use cases such as SOAR integration, playbooks, and automations.
