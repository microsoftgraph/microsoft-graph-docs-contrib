## Permissions

Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions).

[!INCLUDE [permissions-table](../includes/permissions/listitem-list-permissions.md)]

## HTTP request

```http
GET /sites/{site-id}/lists/{list-id}/items
GET /sites/{site-id}/lists/{list-id}/items?expand=fields
GET /sites/{site-id}/lists/{list-id}/items?expand=fields(select=Column1,Column2)
```

## Optional query parameters

This method supports the `$filter` and `$expand` of the [OData query parameters](/graph/query-parameters) to help customize the response. 

### Using the $filter query parameter

You can apply the `$filter` (`eq`, `ne`, `lt`, `gt`, `le`, `ge`, and `startswith`) query parameter to get a subset of the [listItem](../resources/listitem.md) collection. Both **listItem** properties and fields can be filtered. When filtering on indexed fields, the service can only filter one indexed field at a time.

> [!NOTE]
> Filtering works best on indexed columns.

Depending on the number of items that match the filtering condition, the results are either be returned all at once or in multiple pages. For more information, see [Paging Microsoft Graph data in your app](/graph/paging).

## Request headers
