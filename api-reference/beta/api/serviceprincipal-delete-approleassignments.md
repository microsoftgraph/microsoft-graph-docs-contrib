# Delete an appRoleAssignment granted to a service principal

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Deletes an [appRoleAssignment](../resources/approleassignment.md) that a service principal has been granted.

App roles which are assigned to service principals are also known as [application permissions](/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-permissions-and-consent#permission-types). Deleting an app role assignment for a service principal is equivalent to revoking the app-only permission grant.

## Permissions

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) | AppRoleAssignment.ReadWrite.All, Directory.AccessAsUser.All    |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported.    |
|Application | AppRoleAssignment.ReadWrite.All |

## HTTP request

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->

```http
DELETE /servicePrincipals/{servicePrincipal-id}/appRoleAssignments/{appRoleAssignment-id}
```

> [!NOTE]
> As a best practice, we recommend deleting app role assignments through the `appRoleAssignedTo` relationship of the _resource_ service principal, instead of the `appRoleAssignments` relationship of the assigned user, group, or service principal.
