# Create organizationalBrandingLocalization
Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Create a new [organizationalBrandingLocalization](../resources/organizationalBrandingLocalization.md) object. This creates a localized branding and at the same time, the default branding if it doesn't exist.

The default branding is created only once. It's loaded when a localized branding isn't configured for the user's browser language. To retrieve the default branding, see [Get branding](organizationalbranding-get.md).

## HTTP request
This request creates a new localization branding and a default branding if one doesn't already exist. 
<!-- {
  "blockType": "ignored"
}
-->
``` http
POST /organization/{organizationId}/branding/localizations
```

## Request headers
|Name|Description|
|:---|:---|
|Authorization|Bearer {token}. Required. Learn more about [authentication and authorization](/graph/auth/auth-concepts).|
|Content-Type|application/json. Required.|

## Request body

The following table lists the properties that are required when you create the [organizationalBrandingLocalization](../resources/organizationalbrandinglocalization.md) object.

| Property     | Type        | Description |
|:-------------|:------------|:------------|
| id | String | An identifier that represents the locale specified using culture names. Culture names follow the RFC 1766 standard in the format "languagecode2-country/regioncode2". The portion "languagecode2" is a lowercase two-letter code derived from ISO 639-1 and "country/regioncode2" is an uppercase two-letter code derived from ISO 3166. For example, U.S. English is `en-US`. You can't create the default branding by setting the value of **id** to the String types `0` or `default`.  <br/><br/>**NOTE:** Multiple branding for a single locale are currently not supported. |

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `201 Created` response code and an [organizationalBrandingLocalization](../resources/organizationalbrandinglocalization.md) object in the response body.

## Examples

The following example creates a branding localization for French (`fr-FR`) localization. Any unspecified properties of the String type inherit from the value in the default branding object. For example, if the signInPageText in the default branding object is `null`, the signInPageText for the `fr-FR` branding created in this request will also be `null`. To override a `null` value without any text, use a string containing only whitespace.
