# List members

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Retrieve a list of the users that are assigned to the directory role.  Only users can be assigned to a directory role.

You can use both the object ID and template ID of the **directoryRole** with this API. The template ID of a built-in role is immutable and can be seen in the role description on the Azure portal. For details, see [Role template IDs](/azure/active-directory/users-groups-roles/directory-assign-admin-roles#role-template-ids).

## Permissions
One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).


|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|

|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported.    |
