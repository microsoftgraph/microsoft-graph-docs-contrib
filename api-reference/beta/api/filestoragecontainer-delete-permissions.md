# Delete permissions


Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Delete permissions from a [fileStorageContainer](../resources/filestoragecontainer.md) object.

By default, this API removes access for an identity to the container and all items within the container, regardless of whether the identity has container-scoped or item-level permissions. You can add an optional `Prefer: onlyRemoveContainerScopedPermission` header when you call the API if only the identity's container-scoped permissions need to be removed. All item-level permissions explicitly granted to the identity (if any) are retained. 

[!INCLUDE [national-cloud-support](../../includes/all-clouds.md)]

## Permissions

Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](/graph/permissions-reference).
