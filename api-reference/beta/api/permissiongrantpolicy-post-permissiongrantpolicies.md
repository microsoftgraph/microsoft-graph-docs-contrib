# Create permissionGrantPolicy

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Creates a [permissionGrantPolicy](../resources/permissiongrantpolicy.md). A permission grant policy is used to describe the conditions under which permissions can be granted (for example, during application consent).

After creating the permission grant policy, you can [add include condition sets](permissiongrantpolicy-post-includes.md) to add matching rules, and [add exclude condition sets](permissiongrantpolicy-post-excludes.md) to add exclusion rules.

For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](/graph/permissions-reference).
