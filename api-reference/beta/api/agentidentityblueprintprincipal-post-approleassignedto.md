# Grant agentIdentityBlueprintPrincipal appRoleAssignedTo

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Assign an app role for a resource agent identity blueprint principal, to a user, group, or client service principal.

App roles that are assigned to agent identity blueprint principals are also known as [application permissions](/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-permissions-and-consent#permission-types). Application permissions can be granted directly with app role assignments, or through a [consent experience](/azure/active-directory/develop/application-consent-experience).

To grant an app role assignment, you need three identifiers:

- `principalId`: The `id` of the **user**, **group** or client **servicePrincipal** to which you are assigning the app role.
- `resourceId`: The `id` of the resource **agent identity blueprint principal** which has defined the app role.
- `appRoleId`: The `id` of the **appRole** (defined on the resource agent identity blueprint principal) to assign to a user, group, or service principal.

## Permissions

Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](/graph/permissions-reference).

## HTTP request

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
POST /servicePrincipals/{id}/Microsoft.Graph.AgentIdentityBlueprintPrincipal/appRoleAssignedTo
```

## Request headers

| Name       | Description|
|:-----------|:----------|
|Authorization|Bearer {token}. Required. Learn more about [authentication and authorization](/graph/auth/auth-concepts).|
| Content-type | application/json. Required. |

## Request body

In the request body, supply a JSON representation of an [appRoleAssignment](../resources/approleassignment.md) object.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `201 Created` response code and an [appRoleAssignment](../resources/approleassignment.md) object in the response body.

## Examples

### Request

The following example shows a request.

<!-- {
  "blockType": "request",
  "name": "agentidentityblueprintprincipal_create_approleassignedto"
}-->

```http
POST https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/servicePrincipals/9028d19c-26a9-4809-8e3f-20ff73e2d75e/Microsoft.Graph.AgentIdentityBlueprintPrincipal/appRoleAssignedTo
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "principalId": "33ad69f9-da99-4bed-acd0-3f24235cb296",
  "resourceId": "9028d19c-26a9-4809-8e3f-20ff73e2d75e",
  "appRoleId": "ef7437e6-4f94-4a0a-a110-a439eb2aa8f7"
}
```

In this example, `{id}` and `{resourceId-value}` would both be the `id` of the resource agent identity blueprint principal, and `{principalId}` would be the `id` of the assigned user, group, or client service principal.

### Response

The following example shows the response.
