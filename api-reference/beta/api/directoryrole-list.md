# List directoryRoles

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

> [!NOTE]
> Microsoft recommends that you use the unified RBAC API instead of this API. The unified RBAC API provides more functionality and flexibility. For more information, see [List roleDefinitions](./rbacapplication-list-roledefinitions.md).

List the directory roles that are activated in the tenant.

This operation only returns roles that have been activated. A role becomes activated when an admin activates the role using the [Activate directoryRole](directoryrole-post-directoryroles.md) API. Not all built-in roles are initially activated. 

When assigning a role using the Microsoft Entra admin center, the role activation step is implicitly done on the admin's behalf. To get the full list of roles that are available in Microsoft Entra, use [List directoryRoleTemplates](directoryroletemplate-list.md).

## Permissions
Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](/graph/permissions-reference).
