## Permissions

Depending on the resource and the permission type (delegated or application) requested, the permission specified in the following table is the least privileged required to call this API. To learn more, including [taking caution](/graph/auth/auth-concepts#best-practices-for-requesting-permissions) before choosing more privileged permissions, search for the following permissions in [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

> [!NOTE]
> Some resources support change notifications in multiple scenarios, each of which may require different permissions. In those cases, use the resource path to differentiate the scenarios.

Response results are based on the context of the calling app. The following sections describe the common scenarios.

<!-- ### aiInteraction -->
[!INCLUDE [copilot-aiinteraction-subscription-notes.md](../../includes/copilot-aiinteraction-subscription-notes.md)]

### Basic scenarios

Most commonly, an application wants to retrieve subscriptions that it originally created for the currently signed-in user or all users in the directory (work/school accounts). These scenarios don't require any special permissions beyond the ones the app used originally to create its subscriptions.

| Context of the calling app | Response contains |
|:-----|:---------------- |
| App is calling on behalf of the signed-in user (delegated permission). <br/>-and-<br/>App has the original permission required to [create the subscription](subscription-post-subscriptions.md).<br/><br/>**Note:** This scenario applies to both personal Microsoft accounts and work/school accounts. | Subscriptions created by **the app** for the signed-in user only. |
| App is calling on behalf of itself (application permission).<br/>-and-<br/>App has the original permission required to [create the subscription](subscription-post-subscriptions.md).<br/><br/>Note: This scenario only applies to work/school accounts.| Subscriptions created by **the app** for itself or any user in the directory.|

### Advanced scenarios

In some cases, an app wants to retrieve subscriptions created by other apps. For example, a user wants to see all subscriptions created by any app on their behalf. Or, a Global Administrator who wants to see all subscriptions from all apps in their directory.
For such scenarios, a delegated permission Subscription.Read.All is required.

| Context of the calling app | Response contains |
|:-----|:---------------- |
| App is calling on behalf of the signed-in user (delegated permission). *The user is a non-admin*. <br/>-and-<br/>App has the permission Subscription.Read.All<br/><br/>Note: This scenario applies to both personal Microsoft accounts and work/school accounts. | Subscriptions created by **any app** for the signed-in user only. |
| App is calling on behalf of the signed-in user (delegated permission). *The user is a Global Administrator*.<br/>-and-<br/>App has the permission Subscription.Read.All<br/><br/>Note: This scenario only applies to work/school accounts. | Subscriptions created by **any app** for **any user** in the directory.|
