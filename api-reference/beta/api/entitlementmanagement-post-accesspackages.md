# Create accessPackage

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Create a new [accessPackage](../resources/accesspackage.md) object.

The access package will be added to an existing [accessPackageCatalog](../resources/accesspackagecatalog.md). After the access package is created, you can then create [accessPackageAssignmentPolicies](../resources/accesspackageassignmentpolicy.md) which specify how users are assigned to the access package.
