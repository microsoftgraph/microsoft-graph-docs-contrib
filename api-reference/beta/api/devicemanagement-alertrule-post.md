## Request body

[!INCLUDE [table-intro](../../includes/update-property-table-intro.md)]

|Property|Type|Description|
|:---|:---|:---|
|alertRuleTemplate|microsoft.graph.deviceManagement.alertRuleTemplate|The rule template of the alert event. The possible values are: `cloudPcProvisionScenario`, `cloudPcImageUploadScenario`, `cloudPcOnPremiseNetworkConnectionCheckScenario`, `cloudPcInGracePeriodScenario`, `cloudPcFrontlineInsufficientLicensesScenario`, `cloudPcInaccessibleScenario`. Use the `Prefer: include-unknown-enum-members` request header to get the following values from this [evolvable enum](/graph/best-practices-concept#handling-future-members-in-evolvable-enumerations): `cloudPcInGracePeriodScenario`.|
|description|String|The rule description.|
|displayName|String|The display name of the rule.|
|enabled|Boolean|The status of the rule that indicates whether the rule is enabled or disabled. If `true`, the rule is enabled; otherwise, the rule is disabled.|
|isSystemRule|Boolean|A value that tells whether the rule is a system rule. If `true`, the rule is a system rule; otherwise, it's a custom-defined rule and can be edited. Only a few properties can be edited on built-in system rules.|
|notificationChannels|[microsoft.graph.deviceManagement.notificationChannel](../resources/devicemanagement-notificationchannel.md) collection|The notification channels of the rule selected by the user.|
|severity|microsoft.graph.deviceManagement.ruleSeverityType|The severity of the rule. The possible values are: `unknown`, `informational`, `warning`, `critical`, `unknownFutureValue`.|
|threshold|[microsoft.graph.deviceManagement.ruleThreshold](../resources/devicemanagement-rulethreshold.md)|The threshold of the rule. This property is deprecated. Use `conditions` instead. |
|conditions|[microsoft.graph.deviceManagement.ruleCondition](../resources/devicemanagement-rulecondition.md) collection|The conditions of the rule. Conditions determine when to send an alert. For example, you can set a condition so that an alert is sent when six or more Cloud PCs fail to provision.|

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `201 Created` response code and an [microsoft.graph.deviceManagement.alertRule](../resources/devicemanagement-alertrule.md) object in the response body.
