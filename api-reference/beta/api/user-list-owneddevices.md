## Permissions
Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](/graph/permissions-reference).

## HTTP request
<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
GET /users/{id | userPrincipalName}/ownedDevices
```
## Optional query parameters

This method supports the `$count`, `$expand`, `$filter`, `$orderby`, `$search`, `$select`, and `$top` [OData query parameters](/graph/query-parameters) to help customize the response. For more information on properties that support query parameters, see the [device resource type](../resources/device.md#properties). 

The use of `$filter` with this API requires the **ConsistencyLevel** header set to `eventual` and `$count`. However, in such scenarios, you can't use `$expand` in the same request as it isn't supported with advanced query parameters. For more information, see [Advanced query capabilities on directory objects](/graph/aad-advanced-queries).

## Request headers
| Header       | Value |
