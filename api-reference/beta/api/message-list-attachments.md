```http
GET /me/messages/{id}/attachments

Attachments for a [message](../resources/message.md) contained in a top level [mailFolder](../resources/mailfolder.md) in a user's mailbox.
```http

```
Attachments for a [message](../resources/message.md) contained in a child folder of a [mailFolder](../resources/mailfolder.md) in a user's mailbox.  The 
example below shows one level of nesting, but a message can be located in a child of a child and so on.
```http
GET /me/mailFolders/{id}/childFolders/{id}/.../messages/{id}/attachments/{id}
GET /users/{id | userPrincipalName}/mailFolders/{id}/childFolders/{id}/messages/{id}/attachments/{id}
```

inline with the rest of the message properties. For example:

```
GET https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/me/messages/{id}?$expand=attachments
```
