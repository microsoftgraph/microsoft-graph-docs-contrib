## HTTP request
<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
Attachments for a [message](../resources/message.md) in a user's mailbox.
```http
GET /me/messages/{id}/attachments
GET /users/{id | userPrincipalName}/messages/{id}/attachments
```
Attachments for a [message](../resources/message.md) contained in a top level [mailFolder](../resources/mailfolder.md) in a user's mailbox.
```http
GET /me/mailFolders/{id}/messages/{id}/attachments
GET /users/{id | userPrincipalName}/mailFolders/{id}/messages/{id}/attachments
```
Attachments for a [message](../resources/message.md) contained in a child folder of a [mailFolder](../resources/mailfolder.md) in a user's mailbox.  The
example below shows one level of nesting, but a message can be located in a child of a child and so on.
```http
GET /me/mailFolders/{id}/childFolders/{id}/.../messages/{id}/attachments/{id}
GET /users/{id | userPrincipalName}/mailFolders/{id}/childFolders/{id}/messages/{id}/attachments/{id}
```
## Optional query parameters
This method supports the [OData Query Parameters](/graph/query-parameters) to help customize the response.

In particular, you can use the $expand query parameter to include all of the message attachments
inline with the rest of the message properties. For example:

```
GET https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/me/messages/{id}?$expand=attachments
```
## Request headers
