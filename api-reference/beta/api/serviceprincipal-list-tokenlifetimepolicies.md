# List assigned tokenLifetimePolicies

List the [tokenLifetimePolicy](../resources/tokenlifetimepolicy.md) objects that are assigned to a [servicePrincipal](../resources/serviceprincipal.md). Only one object is returned in the collection because only one tokenLifetimePolicy can be assigned to a service principal.
