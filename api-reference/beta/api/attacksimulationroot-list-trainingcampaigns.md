## HTTP request

<!-- {

## Optional query parameters

This method supports the `$count`, `$filter`, `$orderby`, `$skipToken`, `$top`, and `$select` [OData query parameters](/graph/query-parameters) to help customize the response. You can use the `$filter` and `$orderby` query parameters on the **campaignSchedule/completionDateTime**, **displayName**, **campaignSchedule/launchDateTime**, and **campaignSchedule/status** properties.

If the result set spans multiple pages, the response body contains an `@odata.nextLink` that you can use to page through the result set.

The following list shows some examples of requests that use the supported OData query parameters:
