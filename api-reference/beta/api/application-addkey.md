# application: addKey

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Add a key credential to an [application](../resources/application.md). This method, along with [removeKey](application-removekey.md), can be used by an application to automate rolling its expiring keys.

> [!NOTE]
> You can continue to use the [Create application](../api/application-post-applications.md) and [Update application](../api/application-update.md) operations to add and update key credentials for any application with or without a user's context. 
>
> You should only provide the public key value when adding a certificate credential to your application. Adding a private key certificate to your application risks compromising the application.

As part of the request validation for this method, a proof of possession of an existing key is verified before the action can be performed. 

Applications that don't have any existing valid certificates (no certificates have been added yet, or all certificates have expired), won't be able to use this service action. You can use the [Update application](../api/application-update.md) operation to perform an update instead.

## Permissions
Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](/graph/permissions-reference).

[!INCLUDE [permissions-table](../includes/permissions/application-addkey-permissions.md)]

> [!NOTE]
> An application does not need any specific permission to roll its own keys. 

## HTTP request

You can address the application using either its **id** or **appId**. **id** and **appId** are referred to as the **Object ID** and **Application (Client) ID**, respectively, in app registrations in the Microsoft Entra admin center.
<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
POST /applications/{id}/addKey
POST /applications(appId='{appId}')/addKey
```

## Request headers

| Name           | Description                |
|:---------------|:---------------------------|
|Authorization|Bearer {token}. Required. Learn more about [authentication and authorization](/graph/auth/auth-concepts).|
| Content-Type   | application/json. Required.|

## Request body

In the request body, provide the following required properties.

| Property       | Type    |Description|
|:---------------|:--------|:----------|
| keyCredential | [keyCredential](../resources/keycredential.md) | The new application key credential to add. The __type__, __usage__ and __key__ are required properties for this usage. Supported key types are:<br><ul><li>`AsymmetricX509Cert`: The usage must be `Verify`.</li><li>`X509CertAndPassword`: The usage must be `Sign`</li></ul>|
| passwordCredential | [passwordCredential](../resources/passwordcredential.md) | Only __secretText__ is required to be set which should contain the password for the key. This property is required only for keys of type `X509CertAndPassword`. Set it to `null` otherwise.|
| proof | String | A self-signed JWT token used as a proof of possession of the existing keys. This JWT token must be signed using the private key of one of the application's existing valid certificates. The token should contain the following claims:<ul><li>**aud**: Audience needs to be `00000002-0000-0000-c000-000000000000`.</li><li>**iss**: Issuer needs to be the ID of the **application** that initiates the request.</li><li>**nbf**: Not before time.</li><li>**exp**: Expiration time should be the value of **nbf** + 10 minutes.</li></ul><br>For steps to generate this proof of possession token, see [Generating proof of possession tokens for rolling keys](/graph/application-rollkey-prooftoken). For more information about the claim types, see [Claims payload](/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-certificate-credentials).|

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and a new [keyCredential](../resources/keycredential.md) object in the response body.
