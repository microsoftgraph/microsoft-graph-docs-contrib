# protectionRuleBase: deleteAndUnprotect

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Delete and unprotect all the artifacts protected by a dynamic rule. This action is only applicable to dynamic rules.

The following points apply when deleting a dynamic rule and unprotecting all artifacts it protects.
- The rule moves to the `deleteRequested` status when this action is performed on a dynamic rule.
- Unprotecting artifacts and deleting rules are asynchronous operations, and they might not complete immediately. 
- This action resets the `dynamicRule` protection source. If the artifact is also protected by another protection source, it's only protected by that source afterward.
- No operation is allowed on a dynamic rule once a rule is in the `deleteRequested` state.
