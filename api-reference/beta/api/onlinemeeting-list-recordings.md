# List recordings

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Get the list of [callRecording](../resources/callrecording.md) objects associated with a scheduled [onlineMeeting](../resources/onlinemeeting.md). This API supports the retrieval of call recordings from private chat meetings and channel meetings. However, private channel meetings are not supported at this time.

> [!NOTE]
> * This API doesn't support meetings created using the [create onlineMeeting API](/graph/api/application-post-onlinemeetings) that are not associated with an event on the user's calendar.
> * This API might not return all results if multiple meetings are scheduled under a single channel post thread.
> * This API works differently in one or more national clouds. For details, see [Microsoft Teams API implementation differences in national clouds](/graph/teamwork-national-cloud-differences).

[!INCLUDE [national-cloud-support](../../includes/global-only.md)]

## Permissions

Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](/graph/permissions-reference).

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored", "name": "onlinemeeting_list_recordings" } -->
|Permission type|Least privileged permissions|Higher privileged permissions|
|:---|:---|:---|
|Delegated (work or school account)|OnlineMeetingRecording.Read.All|Not available.|
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account)|Not supported.|Not supported.|
|Application|OnlineMeetingRecording.Read.All, OnlineMeetingRecording.Read.Chat|Not available.|

> **Note:** The application permission `OnlineMeetingRecording.Read.Chat` uses [resource-specific consent](/microsoftteams/platform/graph-api/rsc/resource-specific-consent). This permission applies only to scheduled private chat meetings, not to channel meetings.

To use application permission for this API, tenant administrators must create an application access policy and grant it to a user. It authorizes the app configured in the policy to fetch online meetings or online meeting artifacts on behalf of that user (with the user ID specified in the request path). For more information, see [Allow applications to access online meetings on behalf of a user](/graph/cloud-communication-online-meeting-application-access-policy).

> [!NOTE]
> * This API is available for a meeting that hasn't expired. For more information, see [Limits and specifications for Microsoft Teams](/microsoftteams/limits-specifications-teams#meeting-expiration).
> * This API is also available to users who are part of the meeting calendar invite, which applies to both private chat meetings and channel meetings.
