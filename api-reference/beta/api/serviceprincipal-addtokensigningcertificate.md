# servicePrincipal: addKey

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

It creates a self-signed signing certificate and returns a [selfSignedCertificate](../resources/selfsignedcertificate.md) which is the public part of the generated certificate. The self-signed signing certificate is composed of 3 resources: the private key ([keyCredential](../resources/keycredential.md) with usage = 'Sign'), the public key ([keyCredential](../resources/keycredential.md) with usage = 'verify'), and the [passwordCredentials](../resources/passwordcredential.md).

All 3 created resources have the same customKeyIdentifier.

The passwordCredential is used to open the pfx/private key. Also, it's associated with the privateKey having both the same `keyId`. 

The subject of the certificate is a constant value. It won't be affected by the optional displayName provided in the POST call.

The startDateTime is set to the same time the certificate is created using the action. 

The endDateTime can be up to 3 years after the certificate is created.
