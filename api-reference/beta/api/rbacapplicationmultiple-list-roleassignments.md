# List unifiedRoleAssignmentMultiple

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Get a list of [unifiedRoleAssignmentMultiple](../resources/unifiedroleassignmentmultiple.md) objects for an RBAC provider.

The following RBAC providers are currently supported:
- Cloud PC 
- device management (Intune)

For other Microsoft 365 applications (like Microsoft Entra ID), use [unifiedRoleAssignment](../resources/unifiedroleassignment.md).

[!INCLUDE [national-cloud-support](../../includes/all-clouds.md)]

## Permissions

The following tables show the least privileged permission or permissions required to call this API on each supported resource type. Follow [best practices](/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions) to request least privileged permissions. For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](/graph/permissions-reference).
