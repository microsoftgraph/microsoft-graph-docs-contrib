[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Get a list of [unifiedRoleAssignmentMultiple](../resources/unifiedroleassignmentmultiple.md) objects for an RBAC provider.

The following RBAC providers are currently supported:
- Cloud PC 
- device management (Intune)

For other Microsoft 365 applications (like Microsoft Entra ID), use [unifiedRoleAssignment](../resources/unifiedroleassignment.md).

[!INCLUDE [national-cloud-support](../../includes/all-clouds.md)]
