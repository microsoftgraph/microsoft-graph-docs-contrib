# Create subscription

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Subscribes a listener application to receive change notifications when the requested type of changes occur to the specified resource in Microsoft Graph.

## Permissions

Creating a subscription requires read permission to the resource. For example, to get change notifications on messages, your app needs the Mail.Read permission. 

 Depending on the resource and the permission type (delegated or application) requested, the permission specified in the following table is the least privileged required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

| Supported resource | Delegated (work or school account) | Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Application |
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|[callRecord](../resources/callrecords-callrecord.md) (/communications/callRecords) | Not supported | Not supported | CallRecords.Read.All  |
|[chatMessage](../resources/chatmessage.md) (/teams/{id}/channels/{id}/messages) | ChannelMessage.Read.All, Group.Read.All, Group.ReadWrite.All | Not supported | ChannelMessage.Read.All  |
|[chatMessage](../resources/chatmessage.md) (/teams/allMessages -- all channel messages in organization) | Not supported | Not supported | ChannelMessage.Read.All  |
|[chatMessage](../resources/chatmessage.md) (/chats/{id}/messages) | Chat.Read, Chat.ReadWrite | Not supported | Chat.Read.All  |
|[chatMessage](../resources/chatmessage.md) (/chats/allMessages -- all chat messages in organization) | Not supported | Not supported | Chat.Read.All  |
|[contact](../resources/contact.md) | Contacts.Read | Contacts.Read | Contacts.Read |
|[driveItem](../resources/driveitem.md) (user's personal OneDrive) | Not supported | Files.ReadWrite | Not supported |
|[driveItem](../resources/driveitem.md) (OneDrive for Business) | Files.ReadWrite.All | Not supported | Files.ReadWrite.All |
|[event](../resources/event.md) | Calendars.Read | Calendars.Read | Calendars.Read |
|[group](../resources/group.md) | Group.Read.All | Not supported | Group.Read.All |
|[group conversation](../resources/conversation.md) | Group.Read.All | Not supported | Not supported |
|[list](../resources/list.md) | Sites.ReadWrite.All | Not supported | Sites.ReadWrite.All |
|[message](../resources/message.md) | Mail.ReadBasic, Mail.Read | Mail.ReadBasic, Mail.Read | Mail.ReadBasic, Mail.Read |
|[presence](../resources/presence.md) | Presence.Read.All | Not supported | Not supported |
|[security alert](../resources/alert.md) | SecurityEvents.ReadWrite.All | Not supported | SecurityEvents.ReadWrite.All |
|[user](../resources/user.md) | User.Read.All | User.Read.All | User.Read.All |

### chatMessage

**chatMessage** subscriptions with delegated permissions do not support resource data (**includeResourceData** must be `false`), and do not require [encryption](/graph/webhooks-with-resource-data).

**chatMessage** subscriptions with application permissions include resource data, and require [encryption](/graph/webhooks-with-resource-data). Subscription creation will fail if [encryptionCertificate](../resources/subscription.md) is not specified. Before creating a **chatMessage** subscription, you must request access. For details, see [Protected APIs in Microsoft Teams](/graph/teams-protected-apis). 

> **Note:** `/teams/allMessages` and `/chats/allMessages` are currently in preview,
and you may use this API without fees, subject to the [Microsoft APIs Terms of Use](https://docs.microsoft.com/legal/microsoft-apis/terms-of-use?context=graph/context). 
Starting in August 2020, it will only be available to users and tenants that have the [required licenses](/graph/teams-licenses). 
Because `/teams/allMessages` and `/chats/allMessages` deliver notifications for all users in the tenant, all users in the tenant must be licensed;
attempts to create subscriptions without the proper licenses will result in a 401 error code.
In the future, Microsoft may require you or your customers to pay additional fees based on the amount of data accessed through the API.

### driveItem

Additional limitations apply for subscriptions on OneDrive  items. The limitations apply to creating as well as managing (getting, updating, and deleting) subscriptions.

On personal OneDrive, you can subscribe to the root folder or any subfolder in that drive. On OneDrive for Business, you can subscribe to only the root folder. Change notifications are sent for the requested types of changes on the subscribed folder, or any file, folder, or other **driveItem** instances in its hierarchy. You cannot subscribe to **drive** or **driveItem** instances that are not folders, such as individual files.

### contact, event, and message

Additional limitations apply for subscriptions on Outlook items. The limitations apply to creating as well as managing (getting, updating, and deleting) subscriptions.

- Delegated permission supports subscribing to items in folders in only the signed-in user's mailbox. That means, for example, you cannot use the delegated permission Calendars.Read to subscribe to events in another user’s mailbox.
- To subscribe to change notifications of Outlook contacts, events, or messages in _shared or delegated_ folders:

  - Use the corresponding application permission to subscribe to changes of items in a folder or mailbox of _any_ user in the tenant.
  - Do not use the Outlook sharing permissions (Contacts.Read.Shared, Calendars.Read.Shared, Mail.Read.Shared, and their read/write counterparts), as they do **not** support subscribing to change notifications on items in shared or delegated folders.

### presence

**presence** subscriptions require [encryption](/graph/webhooks-with-resource-data). Subscription creation will fail if [encryptionCertificate](../resources/subscription.md) is not specified.

## HTTP request

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->

```http
POST /subscriptions
```

## Request headers

| Name       | Type | Description|
|:-----------|:------|:----------|
| Authorization  | string  | Bearer {token}. Required. |

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `201 Created` response code and a [subscription](../resources/subscription.md) object in the response body.

For details about how errors are returned, see [Error responses][error-response].

## Example

### Request

In the request body, supply a JSON representation of the [subscription](../resources/subscription.md) object.
The `clientState` and `latestSupportedTlsVersion` fields are optional.

This request creates a subscription for change notifications about new mail received by the currently signed in user.

|[Users](../resources/user.md)|`users`|
|[Security alert](../resources/alert.md)|`security/alerts?$filter=status eq 'NewAlert'`|

> **Note:** Any path starting with `me` can also be used with `users/{id}` instead of `me` to target a specific user instead of the current user.

### Response

### Notification endpoint validation

The subscription notification endpoint (specified in the **notificationUrl** property) must be capable of responding to a validation request as described in [Set up notifications for changes in user data](/graph/webhooks#notification-endpoint-validation). If validation fails, the request to create the subscription returns a 400 Bad Request error.
