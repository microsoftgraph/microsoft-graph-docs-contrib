# List versions of a driveItem

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

OneDrive and SharePoint can be configured to retain the history for files.
Depending on the service and configuration, a new version can be created for each edit, each time the file is saved, manually, or never.

Previous versions of a document may be retained for a finite period of time depending on admin settings that may be unique per user or location.

    }
  ]
}
```

## Remarks

Versions are returned in descending order (newest to oldest). The OData `$orderby` query string parameter isn't supported.

OneDrive doesn't preserve the complete metadata for previous versions of a file.

When your app retrieves the list of available versions for a file, a [driveItemVersion](../resources/driveitemversion.md) resource is returned that provides the available information about the specific version.
