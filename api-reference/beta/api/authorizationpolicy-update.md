Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Update the properties of a [authorizationPolicy](../resources/authorizationpolicy.md) object.

[!INCLUDE [national-cloud-support](../../includes/all-clouds.md)]

## Permissions

Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](/graph/permissions-reference).

<!-- { "blockType": "permissions", "name": "authorizationpolicy_update" } -->
[!INCLUDE [permissions-table](../includes/permissions/authorizationpolicy-update-permissions.md)]

For delegated scenarios, the user needs to have the *Privileged Role Administrator* [Microsoft Entra role](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference?toc=%2Fgraph%2Ftoc.json).

## HTTP request

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->

```http
PATCH /policies/authorizationPolicy/authorizationPolicy
```

## Request headers

| Name       | Description|
|:-----------|:-----------|
|Authorization|Bearer {token}. Required. Learn more about [authentication and authorization](/graph/auth/auth-concepts).|
| Content-type | application/json |

## Request body

[!INCLUDE [table-intro](../../includes/update-property-table-intro.md)]

| Property     | Type        | Description |
|:-------------|:------------|:------------|
|allowEmailVerifiedUsersToJoinOrganization|Boolean| Indicates whether a user can join the tenant by email validation. |
|allowUserConsentForRiskyApps|Boolean| Indicates whether [user consent for risky apps](/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/configure-risk-based-step-up-consent) is allowed. Default value is `false`. We recommend that you keep the value set to `false`.|
|allowedToSignUpEmailBasedSubscriptions|Boolean| Indicates whether users can sign up for email-based subscriptions. |
|allowedToUseSSPR|Boolean|  Indicates whether administrators of the tenant can use the Self-Service Password Reset (SSPR). For more information, see [Self-service password reset for administrators](/entra/identity/authentication/concept-sspr-policy#administrator-reset-policy-differences). |
|blockMsolPowerShell|Boolean| To disable the use of MSOL PowerShell, set this property to `true`. This also disables user-based access to the legacy service endpoint used by MSOL PowerShell. This doesn't affect Microsoft Entra Connect or Microsoft Graph. |
|defaultUserRolePermissions|[defaultUserRolePermissions](../resources/defaultUserRolePermissions.md)| Specifies certain customizable permissions for default user role. |
|description|String| Description of this policy. |
|displayName|String| Display name for this policy. |
|enabledPreviewFeatures|String collection| List of features enabled for private preview on the tenant. |
|guestUserRoleId|Guid| Represents role templateId for the role that should be granted to guest user. Refer to [List unifiedRoleDefinitions](./rbacapplication-list-roledefinitions.md) to find the list of available role templates. Only supported roles today are User (`a0b1b346-4d3e-4e8b-98f8-753987be4970`), Guest User (`10dae51f-b6af-4016-8d66-8c2a99b929b3`), and Restricted Guest User (`2af84b1e-32c8-42b7-82bc-daa82404023b`). |
|permissionGrantPolicyIdsAssignedToDefaultUserRole | String collection | Indicates whether user consent to apps is allowed, and if it is, which [app consent policy](/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/manage-app-consent-policies) governs the permission for users to grant consent. Values should be in the format `managePermissionGrantsForSelf.{id}`, where `{id}` is the **id** of a built-in or custom [app consent policy](/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/manage-app-consent-policies). An empty list indicates user consent to apps is disabled. |
