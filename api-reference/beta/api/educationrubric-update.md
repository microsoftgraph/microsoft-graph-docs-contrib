# Update educationRubric

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Update the properties of an [educationRubric](../resources/educationrubric.md) object. Only teachers can perform this operation.

Updating a rubric attached to an assignment (`PATCH /education/classes/{id}/assignments/{id}/rubric`) is only possible before the assignment is published, and what is updated is actually the original rubric that exists under `/education/users/{id}/rubrics`. After the assignment is published, an immutable copy of the rubric is made that is attached to that specific assignment. That rubric can be retrieved using [GET /education/classes/{id}/assignments/{id}/rubric](educationrubric-get.md), but it cannot be updated.
