# schedule: share

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Share a [schedule](../resources/schedule.md) time range with schedule members.

This action makes the collections of [shift](../resources/shift.md), [openshift](../resources/openshift.md) and [timeOff](../resources/timeoff.md) items in the specified time range of the [schedule](../resources/schedule.md) viewable by the specified team members, including employees and managers.

Each [shift](../resources/shift.md), [openshift](../resources/openshift.md) and [timeOff](../resources/timeoff.md) instance in a [schedule](../resources/schedule.md) supports a draft version and a shared version of the item. The draft version is viewable only by managers, and the shared version is viewable by employees and managers. For each [shift](../resources/shift.md), [openshift](../resources/openshift.md) and [timeOff](../resources/timeoff.md) instance in the specified time range, the share action updates the shared version from the draft version, so that in addition to managers, employees can also view the most current information about the item. The **notifyTeam** parameter further specifies which employees can view the item.

> **Note:** To streamline the user experience, update all draft properites and then share all pending changes within a date range as a single action. The draft versions of the properties must be empty before you can update the shared versions of the items.
