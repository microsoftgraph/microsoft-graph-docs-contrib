# List accessReview decisions (deprecated)

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

[!INCLUDE [accessreviews-disclaimer](../../includes/accessreviews-disclaimer.md)]

In the Microsoft Entra [access reviews](../resources/accessreviews-root.md) feature, retrieve the decisions of an [accessReview](../resources/accessreview.md) object.

Note that a recurring access review will not have a **decisions** relationship.  Instead, the caller must navigate the **instance** relationship to find an [accessReview](../resources/accessreview.md) object for a current or past instance of the access review.
