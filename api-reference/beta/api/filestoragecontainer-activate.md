# fileStorageContainer: activate  

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Activate a [fileStorageContainer](../resources/filestoragecontainer.md) object.

A **fileStorageContainer** object is created in an inactive state, as indicated by the **status** property. A container that isn't activated within 24 hours after creation is automatically deleted. Upon activation, the value of the status property changes from `inactive` to `active`.

A file storage container can be activated by calling this API or any API that updates or modifies it or its content. For example, uploading a file to a file storage container activates it. It's also activated when you add permissions to it or update them, or create a custom property on it.

## Permissions

Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](/graph/permissions-reference).
