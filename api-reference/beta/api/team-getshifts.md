# team: getShifts

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Get all [shift](../resources/shift.md) objects across all teams to which a user is a direct member.

## Permissions

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

<!-- {
  "blockType": "permissions",
  "name": "team-getshifts-permissions"
}
-->
[!INCLUDE [permissions-table](../includes/permissions/team-getshifts-permissions.md)]

## HTTP request

<!-- {
  "blockType": "ignored"
}
-->
``` http
GET /me/joinedTeams/getShifts
GET /users/{id | user-principal-name}/joinedTeams/getShifts
```

## Optional query parameters

This method supports the `$top` and `$filter` [OData query parameters](/graph/query-parameters) to help customize the response.

> [!NOTE]
> The `$filter` parameter supports the **sharedShift/startDateTime**, **sharedShift/endDateTime**, **userId** and **teamInfo/teamId** properties. It doesn't support the use of the same property more than once in a query. For example, the following query doesn't work: `sharedShift/startDateTime ge 2024-05-09T00:00:00Z and sharedShift/startDateTime le 2024-05-09T23:59:59Z`; however, the following query works: `sharedShift/startDateTime ge 2024-05-09T00:00:00Z and sharedShift/endDateTime le 2024-05-09T23:59:59Z`.
