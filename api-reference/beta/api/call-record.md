# call: record

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Record a short audio clip from the call. This is useful if the bot wants to capture a voice response from the caller following a prompt.

> [!Note]
> The record action is supported only for [calls](../resources/call.md) that are initiated with [serviceHostedMediaConfig](../resources/servicehostedmediaconfig.md). This action does not record the entire call. The maximum length of the recording is 5 minutes. The recording is not saved permamently by the Cloud Communications Platform and is discarded shortly after the call ends. The bot must download the recording promptly (using the **recordingLocation** value given in the completed notification) after the recording operation finishes.
