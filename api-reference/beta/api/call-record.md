# call: recordResponse

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Record a short audio response from the caller.

A bot can use this API to capture a voice response from a caller after they're prompted for a response.

For more information about how to handle operations, see [commsOperation](../resources/commsOperation.md).

>**Note:** This API is only supported for [calls](../resources/call.md) that are initiated with [serviceHostedMediaConfig](../resources/servicehostedmediaconfig.md).

This action isn't intended to record the entire call. The maximum length of recording is 2 minutes.The Cloud Communications Platform doesn't save the recording permanently and discards it shortly after the call ends. The bot must download the recording promptly after the recording operation finishes by using the recordingLocation value provided in the completed notification.

>**Note:** You may not record or otherwise persist media content from calls or meetings that your application accesses, or data derived from that media content. Make sure you are compliant with the laws and regulations of your area regarding data protection and confidentiality of communications. For more information, see the [Terms of Use](/legal/microsoft-apis/terms-of-use) and consult with your legal counsel.
