# Get educationSubmission

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Retrieve a particular [submission](../resources/educationsubmission.md). Only teachers, students, and applications with application permissions can perform this operation.

A **submission** object represents a student's work for an [assignment](../resources/educationassignment.md). Resources associated with the **submission** represent this work.

Only the **assignedTo** student can see and modify the **submission**. A teacher or application with application permissions has full access to all **submissions**.

The grade and feedback from a teacher are part of the [educationOutcome](../resources/educationoutcome.md) associated with this object. Only teachers or applications with application permissions can add or change grades and feedback. Students will not see the grade or feedback until the **assignment** has been released.

Provide the header `Prefer: include-unknown-enum-members` to properly list **submissions** with the `reassigned` status. For details, see the examples section.

[!INCLUDE [national-cloud-support](../../includes/global-only.md)]

You can use `$orderby` with the following properties of the [educationSubmission](../resources/educationsubmission.md) resource: **excusedDateTime**, **reassignedDateTime**, **returnedDateTime**, **status**, **submittedDateTime**, and **unsubmittedDateTime**.

## Request headers

|:---------------|:--------|
|Authorization|Bearer {token}. Required. Learn more about [authentication and authorization](/graph/auth/auth-concepts).|
| Prefer  | `include-unknown-enum-members`. Optional.  |
