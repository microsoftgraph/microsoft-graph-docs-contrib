      Error: microsoft.graph.microsoft.graph/applications:
        /applications/{var}/onPremisesPublishing/segmentsConfiguration/microsoft.graph.webSegmentConfiguration/applicationSegments/{var}/corsConfigurations/{var}
        Uri path requires navigating into unknown object hierarchy: missing property 'microsoft.graph.webSegmentConfiguration' on 'segmentConfiguration'. Possible issues:
          1) Doc bug where 'microsoft.graph.webSegmentConfiguration' isn't defined on the resource.
          2) Doc bug where 'microsoft.graph.webSegmentConfiguration' is an example key and should instead be replaced with a placeholder like {item-id} or declared in the sampleKeys annotation.
          3) Doc bug where 'segmentConfiguration' is supposed to be an entity type, but is being treated as a complex because it (and its ancestors) are missing the keyProperty annotation.
