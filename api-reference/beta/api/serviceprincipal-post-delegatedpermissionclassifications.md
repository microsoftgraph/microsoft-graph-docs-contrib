# Create delegatedPermissionClassification

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Classify a delegated permission by adding a [delegatedPermissionClassification](../resources/delegatedpermissionclassification.md) to the [servicePrincipal](../resources/servicePrincipal.md) representing the API.

[!INCLUDE [national-cloud-support](../../includes/global-us.md)]

## Permissions

Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](/graph/permissions-reference).

You can address the service principal using either its **id** or **appId**. **id** and **appId** are referred to as the **Object ID** and **Application (Client) ID**, respectively, in app registrations in the Microsoft Entra admin center.
