# Download contents of a DriveItemVersion resource (preview)

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Retrieve the contents of a specific version of a [driveItem](../resources/driveitem.md).

>**Note:** Getting the content of the current version is not supported. Instead, use the [driveItem content endpoint](driveitem-get-content.md).

## Permissions

Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](/graph/permissions-reference).

## HTTP request

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored"} -->

```http
GET /drives/{drive-id}/items/{item-id}/versions/{version-id}/content
GET /groups/{group-id}/drive/items/{item-id}/versions/{version-id}/content
GET /me/drive/items/{item-id}/versions/{version-id}/content
GET /sites/{site-id}/drive/items/{item-id}/versions/{version-id}/content
GET /users/{user-id}/drive/items/{item-id}/versions/{version-id}/content
```

## Response

Returns a `302 Found` response redirecting to a preauthenticated download URL for the bytes of the file.

To download the contents of the file your application needs to follow the `Location` header in the response.
Many HTTP client libraries will automatically follow the 302 redirection and start downloading the file immediately.

Preauthenticated download URLs are only valid for a short period of time (a few minutes) and don't require an `Authorization` header to download.

## Example

This example retrieves a version of a file in the current user's drive.

### Response

Returns a redirect to where the contents of the version can be downloaded.

<!-- { "blockType": "response", "isEmpty": true  } -->

```http
HTTP/1.1 302 Redirect
Location: https://onedrive.com/34FF49D6...
```


## Remarks

OneDrive doesn't preserve the complete metadata for previous versions of a file.

When your app retrieves the list of available versions for a file, a [driveItemVersion](../resources/driveitemversion.md) resource is returned that provides the available information about the specific version.
