Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

> [!NOTE]
> Microsoft recommends that you use the unified RBAC API instead of this API. The unified RBAC API provides more functionality and flexibility. For more information, see [List roleDefinitions](./rbacapplication-list-roledefinitions.md).

## Permissions
Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](/graph/permissions-reference).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In delegated scenarios with work or school accounts, the signed-in user must be assigned a supported [Microsoft Entra role](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference?toc=%2Fgraph%2Ftoc.json) or a custom role with a supported role permission. *Global Reader* is the least privileged role supported for this operation.
