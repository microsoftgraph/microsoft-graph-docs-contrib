# Stop accessReviewInstance

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Stop a currently active [accessReviewInstance](../resources/accessreviewinstance.md). After the access review instance stops, the instance status will be `Completed`, the reviewers can no longer give input, and the access review decisions can be applied.

Stopping an instance will not effect future instances. To prevent a recurring access review from starting future instances, [update the schedule definition](accessreviewscheduledefinition-update.md) to change its scheduled end date.
