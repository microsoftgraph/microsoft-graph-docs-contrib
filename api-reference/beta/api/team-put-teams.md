# Create team from group

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This API is in the process of being deprecated in favor of [Create team](../api/team-post.md), and will be removed by the end of 2019. For details about how to create a team from a group, see examples 4 and 5 in [Create team](../api/team-post.md).

Create a new [team](../resources/team.md) from a [group](../resources/group.md).

In order to create a team, the group must have a least one owner.

If the group was created less than 15 minutes ago, it's possible for the Create team call to fail with a 404 error code due to replication delays. 
The recommended pattern is to retry the Create team call three times, with a 10 second delay between calls.

## Permissions

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |

|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported.    |
|Application | Group.ReadWrite.All, Directory.ReadWrite.All |

> **Note**: This API supports admin permissions. Global admins and Microsoft Teams service admins can access groups that they are not a member of.
