# Create accessPackageAssignmentRequest

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

In [Microsoft Entra Entitlement Management](../resources/entitlementmanagement-overview.md), create a new [accessPackageAssignmentRequest](../resources/accesspackageassignmentrequest.md) object.  This operation is used to assign a user to an access package, or to remove an access package assignment.

## HTTP request

> [!NOTE]
> This API will be retired soon. Use the [Post assignmentRequests](../api/entitlementmanagement-post-assignmentrequests.md) API instead.

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->

```http
POST /identityGovernance/entitlementManagement/accessPackageAssignmentRequests
```

## Request headers

| Name          | Description   |
|:--------------|:--------------|
|Authorization|Bearer {token}. Required. Learn more about [authentication and authorization](/graph/auth/auth-concepts).|
| Content-Type  | application/json. Required. |

## Request body

In the request body, supply a JSON representation of [accessPackageAssignmentRequest](../resources/accesspackageassignmentrequest.md) object.

For an administrator to request to create an assignment for a user, the value of the **requestType** property is `AdminAdd`, and the **accessPackageAssignment** property contains the `targetId` of the user being assigned, the **assignmentPolicyId** property identifying the [accessPackageAssignmentPolicy](../resources/accesspackageassignmentpolicy.md), and the **accessPackageId** property identifying the [accessPackage](../resources/accesspackage.md).

For an administrator to request to remove an assignment, the value of the **requestType** property is `AdminRemove`, and the **accessPackageAssignment** property contains the **id** property identifying the [accessPackageAssignment](../resources/accesspackageassignment.md) being removed.

For a non-administrator user to request to create their own assignment for either a first assignment or renew assignment, the value of the **requestType** property is `UserAdd`. The **accessPackageAssignment** property contains the `targetId` with the `id` of the users. The **assignmentPolicyId** property identifies the [accessPackageAssignmentPolicy](../resources/accesspackageassignmentpolicy.md). The **accessPackageId** property identifies the [accessPackage](../resources/accesspackage.md). The user making the request must already exist in the directory.

For a non-administrator user to request to extend their own assignments, the value of the **requestType** property is `UserExtend`. The **accessPackageAssignment** property contains the `targetId` with the `id` of the users. The **assignmentPolicyId** property identifies the [accessPackageAssignmentPolicy](../resources/accesspackageassignmentpolicy.md). The **accessPackageId** property identifies the [accessPackage](../resources/accesspackage.md). The user making the request must already exist in the directory.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a 200-series response code and a new [accessPackageAssignmentRequest](../resources/accesspackageassignmentrequest.md) object in the response body.  

If this is an `AdminAdd` request, then subsequently an [accessPackageAssignment](../resources/accesspackageassignment.md) and, if needed, an [accessPackageSubject](../resources/accesspackagesubject.md) are also created. You can locate those using the query parameters when [listing accessPackageAssignments](entitlementmanagement-list-accesspackageassignments.md).

## Examples

### Example 1: Admin requests a direct assignment for a user already in the directory

#### Request

The following example shows a request for a direct assignment, in which the administrator requests the creation of an assignment for a user. Because the [accessPackageSubject](../resources/accesspackagesubject.md) might not yet exist, the value of the **targetID** is the object ID of the user being assigned, the value of the **accessPackageId** is the desired access package for that user, and the value of **assignmentPolicyId** is a direct assignment policy in that access package.

### Example 2: Remove an assignment

To remove assignments, create a new accessPackageAssignmentRequest object with the following settings:

* The value of the **requestType** property set to `AdminRemove`.
* In the **accessPackageAssignment** property, include an object with the identifier of the **accessPackageAssignment** objects to delete.
