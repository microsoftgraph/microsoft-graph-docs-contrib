# accessReviewInstance: acceptRecommendations

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Allows the acceptance of recommendations on all [accessReviewInstanceDecisionItem](../resources/accessreviewinstancedecisionitem.md) objects that haven't been reviewed for an [accessReviewInstance](../resources/accessreviewinstance.md) object for which the calling user is a reviewer. Recommendations are generated if **recommendationsEnabled** is `true` on the [accessReviewScheduleDefinition](../resources/accessreviewscheduledefinition.md) object. If there isn't a recommendation on an [accessReviewInstanceDecisionItem](../resources/accessreviewinstancedecisionitem.md) object no decision will be recorded.
