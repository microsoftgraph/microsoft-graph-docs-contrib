# fileStorageContainer: permanentDelete

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Permanently delete a [fileStorageContainer](../resources/filestoragecontainer.md) object. Deleting a file storage container with this method permanently removes it. It isn't sent to the deleted container collection. Therefore, it can't be restored later.
