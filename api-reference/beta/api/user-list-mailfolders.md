# List mailFolders

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Get the mail folder collection directly under the root folder of the signed-in user. The returned collection includes any [mail search folders](../resources/mailsearchfolder.md) directly under the root.

By default, this operation does not return hidden folders. Use a query parameter `includeHiddenFolders` to include them in the response. This operation does not return all mail folders in a mailbox, only the child folders of the root folder. To return all mail folders in a mailbox, each child folder must be [traversed separately](mailfolder-list-childfolders.md).

[!INCLUDE [national-cloud-support](../../includes/all-clouds.md)]

## Permissions

Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](/graph/permissions-reference).

<!-- { "blockType": "permissions", "name": "user_list_mailfolders" } -->
[!INCLUDE [permissions-table](../includes/permissions/user-list-mailfolders-permissions.md)]

## HTTP request

To get all the mail folders in the root folder in the specified user's mailbox, excluding those that are hidden:
<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
GET /me/mailFolders
GET /users/{id | userPrincipalName}/mailFolders
```

To include _hidden_ mail folders in the response:
<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
GET /me/mailFolders/?includeHiddenFolders=true
GET /users/{id | userPrincipalName}/mailFolders/?includeHiddenFolders=true
```

## Optional query parameters

To return a list of all mailFolders including those that are hidden (their **isHidden** property is true), in the request URL, specify the `includeHiddenFolders` query parameter as `true`, as shown in the [HTTP request](#http-request) section.

This method supports [OData query parameters](/graph/query-parameters) to help customize the response.

## Request headers

| Header        | Value                     |
|:--------------|:--------------------------|
|Authorization|Bearer {token}. Required. Learn more about [authentication and authorization](/graph/auth/auth-concepts).|

## Request body

Don't supply a request body for this method.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and a collection of [mailFolder](../resources/mailfolder.md) objects in the response body.

## Examples

### Example 1: List mail folders in the signed-in user's mailbox

This example includes a **mailSearchFolder** object in the response. The mail search folder is a child folder under the Inbox with the display name "Weekly digests".

### Example 2: Include hidden folders in the signed-in user's mailbox
