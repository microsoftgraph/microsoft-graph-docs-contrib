# Delete temporaryAccessPassAuthenticationMethod
Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Delete a [temporaryAccessPassAuthenticationMethod](../resources/temporaryaccesspassauthenticationmethod.md) object.

While the current Temporary Access Pass on the user is valid, it needs to be deleted before a new Temporary Access Pass can be created on the user.
