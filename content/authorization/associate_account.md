# Associate your Office 365 account with Azure AD to create and manage apps

To authenticate your applications, you need to register them in Microsoft Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). This is where Office 365 user account and application information is stored. To manage Azure AD through the Azure Management Portal, you need a Microsoft Azure subscription. Using the management portal in Microsoft Azure enables you to manage users, roles, and apps. 

This article guides you through associating your Office 365 account with Azure AD to create and manage apps.


## Prerequisites

**Office 365 for business account**

If you don't have an existing Office 365 for business account, you can:

- Sign up for an [Office 365 for business plans](http://products.office.com/en-us/business/compare-office-365-for-business-plans) listed above, or
- Start with a [free 30-day trial of an Office 365 Developer account](https://portal.microsoftonline.com/Signup/MainSignUp.aspx?OfferId=6881A1CB-F4EB-4db3-9F18-388898DAF510&amp;DL=DEVELOPERPACK).

**Microsoft Azure subscription** 

- If you can have an existing Microsoft Azure subscription, you can associate your Office 365 for business subscription with it. 

- Otherwise, you'll need to create a new Azure subscription and associate it with your Office 365 account in order to register and manage apps.

5. In **Add directory**, in the **Directory** drop-down box, select  **Use existing directory**. Check **I am ready to be signed out**, and then select the check mark in the lower-right corner. 
	
	This brings you back to the Azure Management Portal.

4. Once your Azure subscription is created, choose  **Portal**.
	    
5. The Azure Tour appears. You can view it, or choose  **X** to close it.
