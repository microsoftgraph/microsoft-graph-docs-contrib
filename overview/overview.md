# Overview of Microsoft Graph

Microsoft Graph exposes multiple APIs from Office 365 and other Microsoft cloud services through a single endpoint:  **https://graph.microsoft.com**. Microsoft Graph simplifies queries that would otherwise be more complex. 
 
You can use Microsoft Graph to:

- Access data from multiple Microsoft cloud services, including Azure Active Directory, Exchange Online as part of Office 365, SharePoint, OneDrive, OneNote, and Planner.
- Navigate between entities and relationships.
- Access intelligence and insights from the Microsoft cloud (for commercial users).

**Microsoft Graph development stack**

![A diagram that shows the layers of the Microsoft Graph development stack. At the bottom is the data layer, which includes users, groups, file, mail, calendars, personal contacts, tasks, org contacts, people, Excel, and notes. The next layer is authentication and authorization. Next is the development environment of your choice, including the Android, iOS, and Visual Studio Microsoft Graph API SDKs. The final layer is your solution, which uses the technology of your choice, including .NET, JS, HTML, and Ruby, and is hosted on Microsoft Azure or another hosting platform.](./images/MicrosoftGraph_DevStack.png)

##Common Microsoft Graph queries

Microsoft Graph exposes two endpoints: /v1.0 and /beta. The /v1.0 endpoint includes the resources that you can access in your production app. The [/beta](http://graph.microsoft.io/en-us/docs/api-reference/beta/beta-overview) endpoint includes APIs that are currently in preview. The following table lists some common queries that you can use to access the Microsoft Graph API.
