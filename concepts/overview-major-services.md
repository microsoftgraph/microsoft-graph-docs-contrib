# Major services and features in Microsoft Graph

Microsoft Graph enables you to integrate with the best of Microsoft 365, Windows 10, and Enterprise Mobility and Security services in Microsoft 365, using REST APIs and client libraries. Additionally, it offers security and intelligence that can boost user productivity, creativity, and team collaboration, and protect business resources and users' data. 

## Users and groups

At the core of Microsoft Graph are the concepts of the user and group. 

A _user_ in Microsoft Graph is one among the millions who use Microsoft 365 cloud services. It is the focal point whose identity is protected and access is well managed. The user's data is what drives businesses. Microsoft Graph services makes this data available to businesses in rich contexts, real-time updates, and deep insights, and, always only with the appropriate permissions.

A Microsoft 365 _group_ is the fundamental entity that lets users collaborate. It integrates with other services, enabling richer scenarios in task planning, teamwork, education, and more.

## Connecting users' data, Microsoft 365 services, and your apps

Starting with users and groups at the core, Microsoft Graph forms a network of Microsoft 365 services and features that manage, protect, and extract data to support a wide range of scenarios. Microsoft Graph lets you access this wealth of user data while always respecting proper authorization.

### Services and features

Some services in Microsoft Graph make their debut there, others have been well-known as standalone services and are now converging in Microsoft Graph. Their API sets follow a streamlined design as detailed in the [Microsoft REST API guidelines](https://github.com/Microsoft/api-guidelines), and are now accessible through the single Microsoft Graph REST endpoint `https://graph.microsoft.com`.
