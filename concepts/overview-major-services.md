# Major services and features in Microsoft Graph

Microsoft Graph enables you to integrate with the best of Office 365, Windows 10, and Enterprise Mobility and Security services in Microsoft 365. Additionally, you can take advantage of security and social intelligence to boost user productivity, creativity, and team collaboration, and to protect business resources and users' data. 

## Users and groups

At the core of Microsoft Graph are the concepts of the user and group. 

The user is the focal point whose identity is protected and access is well managed. It's the user's data that drives businesses. Microsoft Graph services makes this data available to businesses in rich contexts, real-time updates, and deep insights.

Groups form the fundamental fabric enabling user collaboration, and integration with other services to support richer scenarios in task planning, teamwork, education, and more.
