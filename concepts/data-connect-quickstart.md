# Build your first Microsoft Graph Data Connect application

<!-- cSpell:ignore rimisra mgdc mgdcdemoap mgdcdemoapp tostorage synapsedatalstorage flsynapse mgdcm influencers -->

Microsoft Graph Data Connect (Data Connect) augments transactional APIs with an intelligent way to access rich data at scale. Data Connect is ideal for big data applications and machine learning as it allows you to develop applications for analytics, intelligence, and business process optimization by extending Microsoft 365 data into Microsoft Azure. Through this offering, you'll be able to take advantage of the vast suite of compute and storage in Azure while staying compliant with industry standards and keeping your data secure.

![An architectural diagram of Microsoft Graph Data Connect, showing defined data controls, extending Office 365 data into Azure, and enabling big data and machine learning.](images/data-connect-mgdc-capabilities.PNG)

Data Connect uses Microsoft Fabric, Azure Synapse, or Azure Data Factory to copy Microsoft 365 data to your application's storage at configurable intervals. It also provides a set of tools to streamline the delivery of this data to Azure, letting you access the most applicable development and hosting tools available.

Data Connect also grants a more granular control and consent model: you can manage data, see who is accessing it, and request specific properties of an entity. This enhances the Microsoft Graph model, which grants or denies applications access to entire entities.

Additionally, you can use Data Connect to enable machine learning scenarios for your organization. In these scenarios, you can create applications that provide valuable information to your stakeholders, train machine learning models, and even perform forecasting based on large amounts of acquired data.

## Get started

In this tutorial, you'll create your first single-tenant Data Connect application. The following general flow explains the Data Connect onboarding process.

![A screenshot that explains the onboarding flow.](images/data-connect-overview-flowchart.png)

1. **Admin enables Data Connect:** The first step in onboarding is for your global administrator to [enable Data Connect](https://admin.microsoft.com/adminportal/home#/Settings/Services/:/Settings/L1/O365DataPlan).

2. **Developer creates a new Microsoft Entra application:** The developer needs to first create a new Microsoft Entra application.

3. **Developer registers the application with Data Connect:** Once the Microsoft Entra application is created, the developer needs to register the application with Data Connect using the new registration portal for [Microsoft Graph Data Connect applications](https://aka.ms/mgdcinazure). In this step, the developer specifies what data they require for their application.

4. **Admin approves the application:** After the developer has registered their application with Data Connect, the global administrator can use the new portal for [Data Connect application consent](https://admin.microsoft.com/adminportal/home#/Settings/MGDCAdminCenter) to review the registered application and approve it.

5. **Developer runs their pipelines:** After the administrator has consented to the application, the developer might run their pipelines without any stalling for runtime consent. The pipeline creation and run via Azure Data Factory or Azure Synapse remains the same.

> [!NOTE]
> If you're working in a new tenant that doesn't have Data Connect enabled, you don't need to take any action. If you have an existing tenant that already has Microsoft Graph Data Connect enabled, before you complete this tutorial, ask your global administrator to toggle Microsoft Graph Data Connect off and then on again in the [admin portal](https://admin.microsoft.com/adminportal/home#/Settings/Services/:/Settings/L1/O365DataPlan).

### Prerequisites

To complete this tutorial, you need the following subscriptions or licenses.

- For this tutorial, we strongly recommend that you use a Microsoft 365 developer tenant.
- Your Microsoft 365 and Azure tenants must be in the same Microsoft Entra tenancy.
- The Azure subscription must be in the same tenant as the Microsoft 365 tenant.
- One user in your Microsoft 365 tenant has the [Global Administrator](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#global-administrator) role enabled. Going forward, this tutorial refers to this user as the "admin". Only an "admin" user can approve the test application.
- A different user in your Microsoft 365 tenant with [Application Administrator](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#application-administrator) or [Application Developer](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#application-developer) role. Going forward, this tutorial refers to this user as the "developer". The developer user does the majority of this tutorial.

1. **Microsoft 365 tenancy**

   - If you don't have a Microsoft 365 tenant, you might qualify for one through the [Microsoft 365 Developer Program](https://developer.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/dev-program); for details, see the [FAQ](/office/developer-program/microsoft-365-developer-program-faq#who-qualifies-for-a-microsoft-365-e5-developer-subscription-). Alternatively, you can [sign up for a 1-month free trial or purchase a Microsoft 365 plan](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/try).

   > [!NOTE]
   > You can't approve your own test application using the same account. Make sure that you have another member (or account) in your tenant that acts as an admin.

1. **Microsoft Azure subscription**

   - If you don't have a Microsoft Azure subscription, visit the following link to get one (for free): [Create your Azure Free Account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
   - Your Azure subscription must be in the same tenant as your Microsoft 365 tenant and both must be in the same Microsoft Entra tenancy.
   - If your Azure subscription isn't in the same tenant as your Microsoft 365 tenant, you can associate your subscription with Microsoft Entra ID in your Microsoft 365 tenant by following the steps listed in [Associate or add an Azure subscription to your Microsoft Entra tenant](/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-how-subscriptions-associated-directory).

   > [!NOTE]
   > The screenshots and examples used in this tutorial are from a Microsoft 365 developer tenant with a sample email from test users. You can use your own Microsoft 365 tenant to perform the same steps. No data is written to Microsoft 365. A copy of email data is extracted from all users in a Microsoft 365 tenant and copied to an Azure Blob Storage account. You maintain control over who has access to the data within the Azure Blob Storage.

## Set up your Microsoft 365 tenant and enable Microsoft Graph Data Connect

Before you use Microsoft Graph Data Connect (Data Connect) for the first time, please work with your Microsoft 365 tenant admin to enable the Data Connect service for your tenant.

For this tutorial, please ensure that you have an account with admin privileges available. You must complete this step to set up your first pipeline. We recommend having at least two users in your Microsoft 365 tenant with the **global administrator** role enabled.

- [Global Administrator built-in role](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#global-administrator).
- [Elevate access to gain the Global Administrator role](/azure/role-based-access-control/elevate-access-global-admin).

### Enable Microsoft Graph Data Connect in your Microsoft 365 tenant

Set up your Microsoft 365 tenant to enable the usage of Microsoft Graph Data Connect.

1. Open a browser, go to your [Microsoft 365 admin portal](https://admin.microsoft.com/), and sign in with your **admin** user.

1. Select **Settings > Org settings**. You might have to choose **Show all** before you're able to view **Settings**.

1. In the **Services** tab (which should be the default selection), select **Microsoft Graph Data Connect**.

1. Select the checkbox to **Turn Microsoft Graph Data Connect on or off for your entire organization** and choose **Save**.

    ![A screenshot showing how to enable data connect in the Microsoft 365 admin center.](images/data-connect-new-consent-flow-enable-mgdc.png)

Congratulations, you just enabled Microsoft Graph Data Connect for your organization!

## Set up your Microsoft Entra application

In this exercise, you learn how to create a Microsoft Entra application. This serves as the security principal to run the data extraction process with Microsoft Graph Data Connect.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) with at least the *Application Administrator* or*Application Developer* role.

1. Expand the **Identity** menu > select **Applications** > **App registrations** > **New registration**.

1. Use the following values to create a new Microsoft Entra application and select **Register**.

   - **Name**: Microsoft Graph Data Connect Data Transfer (provide the name of your choice).
   - **Supported account types**: Accounts in this organizational directory only.
   - **Redirect URI**: Leave the default values.

    ![A screenshot that shows the steps to register a new application registration in the Azure portal.](images/data-connect-aad-redirect-uri.png)

1. Locate the **Application (client) ID** and copy it as you need it later in this tutorial. Going forward, this is referred to as the service principal ID.

1. Locate the **Directory (tenant) ID** and copy it as you need it later in this tutorial. Going forward, this is referred to as the tenant ID.

    ![A screenshot that shows the application and tenant IDs.](images/data-connect-app-tenant-new.png)

1. On the left navigation pane, select **Certificates & secrets** under **Manage**.

1. Select the **New client secret** button. Set *Description* to any name, set *Expires* to any value in the dropdown, and choose **Add**.

    ![A screenshot that shows the process to create a new client secret in the Azure portal.](images/data-connect-aad-certs-secrets-new.png)

    - After the client secret is created, make sure you save the **Value** somewhere safe, as it will no longer be available later; otherwise, you'll need to create a new one.
    - Going forward, the client secret is referred as the service principal key.

1. On the left navigation pane for the application, select **Owners**.

1. Ensure that your account (if you're using a developer tenant use the Global admin account) meets the following requirements to be an application owner:

    - Your user account corresponds to a valid user in the tenant who isn't a service principal name.
    - Your account must have an Exchange Online license assigned (must have a mailbox).
    - Alongside the Exchange Online license, your account must also have a working E5 subscription/license.

1. Verify that your account is listed as an application owner. If that isn't the case, add it to the list.

    ![A screenshot that shows a user set as owner for the application registration in the Azure portal.](images/data-connect-aad-app-owners-new.png)

## Set up your Azure Storage resource

In this step you will create an Azure Storage account where Microsoft Graph Data Connect will store the data extracted from Microsoft 365 for further processing.

1. Open a browser and go to your [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

1. Sign in using an account with an **[Application developer](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#application-developer)** role to your Azure portal.

1. On the sidebar navigation, select **Create a resource**.

1. Find the **Storage account** resource type and use the following values to configure it. For **Performance**, **Redundancy**, and the **Advanced tab**, the values for these fields are an example.

    - **Subscription**: select your Azure subscription
    - **Resource group**: mgdc-app-resource (or select an existing resource group)
    - **Storage account name**: mgdcdemoap (or you can name and select your own storage account)
    - **Region**: [pick an Azure region in the same region as your Microsoft 365 region](/graph/data-connect-datasets#regions)
    - **Performance**: Standard

      - **Access tier**: Hot

    ![Screenshot of the Create a storage account page with Subscription, Resource group, Storage account name, and Region highlighted](images/data-connect-azure-storageaccount-create.png)

1. After configuring the values for the **Basics** and **Advanced** tabs, leave the rest of the settings as default.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Ensure that within the **Networking** tab, the **Enable public access from all networks** is enabled. You can also select the second option **Enable public access from selected virtual networks and IP addresses**; however, additional steps outside of this tutorial need to be performed, which are highlighted in the [IP addresses section](../concepts/data-connect-troubleshooting.md#issues-adding-network-ip-address-to-allow-list-with-azure-integration-runtime).

    ![Screenshot of the Create a storage account page with Networking and Enable public access from all networks highlighted](images/data-connect-azure-storage-network-new.png)

1. Review that the settings match those shown in the previous steps and select **Create** to finalize.

1. After the Azure Storage account has been created, grant the Microsoft Entra application previously created the proper access to it.

    1. Select the **Azure Storage account**.
    1. On the sidebar menu, select **Access control (IAM)**.
    1. Select the **Add** button in the **Add a role assignment** block.
    1. Grant the **Storage Blob Data Contributor** role to the application you previously created.
        1. Select *Storage Blob Data Contributor* as the **Role**, and click **Next**.
        1. **Assign access to** *User, group or service principal*.
        1. Click **+ Select members**, and in the right pane that displays, search for the application (Microsoft Graph data connect Data Transfer) that you previously created, and click **Select**.
    1. Select **Review + assign**.

1. Hover over the **Activity name** and select the goggles option. This will open the **Details** tab.

    ![A screenshot of the pipeline page with the bottom pane highlighted.](images/data-connect-synapse-activity-run.png)

1. In the **Details** screen, look for the status of the pipeline activity as highlighted in the following image. The status should progress through Initializing, Consent Pending, Extracting Data, Persisting Data and Succeeded – no further action needed from you for this.

    ![A screenshot of the Details page with ConsentPending highlighted.](images/data-connect-synapse-accept-request.png)

1. The request is sent to the global admin to be approved. For the context of this tutorial, we recommend opening another tab with your admin privileges enabled so you can approve the pipeline request.

#### [Create an Azure Data Factory Pipeline](#tab/AzureDataFactoryPipeline)

1. Open a browser and go to your [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

1. Sign in to the Azure portal with an account that has either the [Application administrator](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#application-administrator) or [Application developer](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#application-developer) role. Make sure you're using your **developer** account, which has the necessary privileges to create Azure resources within your subscription.

1. On the home page, select **Create a resource**.

1. Find the **Data Factory** resource type and use the following values to create it, then select **Create**.

    - **Subscription**: Select your Azure subscription.
    - **Resource group**:  Select the resource group you created previously.
    - **Region**: [pick an Azure region in the same region as your Microsoft 365 region](/graph/data-connect-datasets#regions)
    - **Name**: dM365toBlobStorage
    - **Version**: V2
    - Select **Review + create**, and then select **Create**.

1. After the Azure Data Factory resource is created, select **Go to resource**, and then select the **Launch studio** button to launch the Azure Data Factory full screen editor.

## (Optional) Visualize your Microsoft Graph Data Connect data in Microsoft Power BI

This exercise describes how to create a report in Microsoft Power BI to visualize your Microsoft 365 data from Microsoft Graph Data Connect.

### Verify JSON file in Azure Storage

1. Open a browser and go to your [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/#home).
1. Under **Azure Services**, choose **Storage accounts**.
1. Select the Azure Storage account you created previously in this tutorial.
1. On the left navigation pane, choose **Containers**.
1. Choose the **m365mails** container that you created previously in this tutorial.
1. You should see the file with a GUID name in your container.

![A screenshot of the Azure portal user interface that shows the newly created file in the Azure Storage container.](images/data-connect-storageaccountcompletion.png)

### Configure Power BI

1. Open your Power BI desktop application. If you need to download Power BI, go to [Download Power BI tools and apps](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/downloads/).

1. Choose **Get Data**, select **Azure** and choose **Azure Blob Storage**.

1. Choose **Connect** to establish the connection between Power BI and your Azure Blob Storage account.

    ![A screenshot that shows how to connect to get data from an Azure Blob Storage in Power BI.](images/data-connect-pbi-connect-blob-storage.png)

1. Enter the Azure Storage Account name and container name for the Azure Blob Storage account you want to connect to, and then choose **OK**.

    ![A screenshot that shows how to add the Azure Blob Storage account URL to get data in Power BI.](images/data-connect-pbi-add-blob-account-name.png)

    > [!NOTE]
    > You can find your Azure Storage URL in the Azure Storage Account. Search through your containers, choose the container you want to connect to, go to the Context menu (...), select **Container Properties**, and copy the URL.

1. Select **Transform Data**, and select the first line that says **Binary**.

    ![A screenshot that shows how to transform the binary data in Power BI.](images/data-connect-pbi-transform-binary.png)

1. To get a list with all the **Records**, go to the Column1 toggle option, select and hold (or right-click) to select **Transform**, then choose **JSON**.

    ![A screenshot that shows how to expand the data columns in Power BI.](images/data-connect-pbi-transform-columns.png)

1. Load all the columns, expand the **Records** from the Column1 toggle, and then choose **OK**.

    ![A screenshot that shows how to load all the columns in Power BI.](images/data-connect-pbi-expand-records.png)

1. The results are shown as `Column1.property`. To expand the columns with nested data, choose the toggle option on each column, and then choose **OK**.

    - Choose **Close & Apply** and wait for your query to load all the columns.

    ![A screenshot that shows how to load all the columns in Power BI.](images/data-connect-pbi-expand-columns-close.png)

1. After all the columns load, you can build visuals with your data.

    - Under **Data**, select **Query1** to expand the columns and choose the properties you want to visualize.
    - Under **Visualizations**, select the **Key Influencers** option to visualize the data.

    > [!NOTE]
    > In this example, you can determine whether users read the messages sent by a department in your organization by analyzing every **toRecipientName** and the **isRead** property.

    ![A screenshot that shows all the columns with content presented in a table in Power BI.](images/data-connect-pbi-key-influencers.png)

1. You can now see the JSON data from the Messages_v1 data set from Microsoft Graph Data Connect in a Power BI report.

    > [!NOTE]
    > You can choose the data connectivity mode (**DirectQuery** or **Import**) depending on your data size and query requirements. We recommend that you use **DirectQuery** in this tutorial.

For solution templates that use Microsoft Graph Data Connect built into Power BI, see the [Data Connect solutions](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/dataconnect-solutions/tree/main/solutions) repo in GitHub.
