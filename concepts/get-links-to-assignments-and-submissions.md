# Get links to assignments and submissions

Education institutions have custom tools for students and users to view details about or complete assignments. You can use education APIs in Microsoft Graph to get deep links to assignments and submissions for use in custom tools. Before you can get links to assignments and submissions, you must get the relevant class and member information.

 > **Note:** You can use [Graph Explorer](https://developer.microsoft.com/graph/graph-explorer) to test the [education APIs](/graph/msgraph-onboarding-graphexplorer) mentioned in this article.

## Get class and member information

All assignments and grading information are part of a team in Microsoft Teams. You can get information about classes, members, and roles (student or teacher) in a team by using the following Teams APIs:

- [List classes of an educationSchools](/graph/api/educationschool-list-classes): Returns a list of all classes in your education tenant.
- [List members of an educationClass](/graph/api/educationclass-list-members): Lists information about members of a specific class.

After you get the relevant class and member information, you can get the assignment and grade information you need.

## Get a deep link for the assignment

The [assignment webUrl property](/graph/api/resources/educationassignment#properties) returns the authenticated deep link to selected assignments. If the user is within Teams, the assignments will open directly with this deep link URL.

The following example describes how to get the deep link URL for a given assignment.

## Permissions

The assignments APIs support both delegated and application permissions. We recommend using application permissions because that permits your app only to retrieve data.
