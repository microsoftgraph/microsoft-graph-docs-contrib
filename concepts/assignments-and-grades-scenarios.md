# Connect to assignments and grades

Microsoft Teams for education is an essential solution that supports educators and students. Assignments and grades are a core part of Teams for education, and provide the central workflow that educators use to assign, assess, grade, and provide feedback to students around the world.

Microsoft Graph provides a set of integration points that enable you to customize and extend the experience for educators, admins, and students when they work with assignments and grades.

## Get started

All Teams for education users have access to assignment and grade functionality. To set up a demo or development tenant for Teams to start building your custom solutions, see [Set up an EDU development environment](/graph/msgraph-onboarding-overview).

## Scenarios

You can read and update data and integrate your app with assignments and grades in multiple ways. The following are some key scenarios that you can apply, in one or more combinations, to integrate with assignments and grades.
