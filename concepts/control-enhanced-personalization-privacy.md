## Data processing scenario

To provide a more personalized experience with Microsoft 365 Copilot. Microsoft, with consent provided from enabling this control, uses a user's private communication data connected to Microsoft 365, such as Microsoft Teams chats, Outlook emails, Microsoft transcripts, and from connectors. This data is used solely to make the individual user's tools more efficient and personalized to them. It's important to note that this information remains confidential and is not shared with other users, ensuring user privacy. The option to disable all linked features for the tenant or a group of users through this scenario control is available anytime, causing Microsoft to cease using a user's data for this purpose.
