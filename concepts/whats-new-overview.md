# What's new in Microsoft Graph

See highlights of what's new in the recent two months in Microsoft Graph, [what's added earlier](whats-new-earlier.md), and how you can [share your ideas](#want-to-stay-in-the-loop). For a detailed list of API-level updates, see the [API changelog](changelog.md). 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Features, including APIs and tools, in _preview_ status may change without notice, and some may never be promoted to generally available (GA) status. Do not use preview features in production apps.

## September 2020: New and generally available

### Reports
[Get a report that includes the count of unique users](/graph/api/reportroot-getemailappusageversionsusercounts) for Outlook 2019 and for Outlook on Microsoft 365.

### Users
Aside from getting the SMTP address of a [user](/graph/api/resources/user) through the **mail** property, you can now set that property and update the user's email address. 

## September 2020: New in preview only

### Cloud communications
- Deprecation of the **autoAdmittedUsers** property of [onlineMeeting](/graph/api/resources/onlinemeeting?view=graph-rest-beta). Instead, use the new **lobbyBypassSettings** property and its [values](/graph/api/resources/lobbybypasssettings?view=graph-rest-beta#lobbybypassscope-values).
- Use additional settings about announcing callers joining or leaving an online meeting (**isEntryExitAnnounced** property), and allowing specific presenters in the meeting (**allowedPresenters** property).

### Devices and apps | Cloud printing
- [Get the documents for each of the print jobs associated with a printer](/graph/api/printer-list-jobs?view=graph-rest-beta), by applying an `$expand` [OData system query option](/graph/api/printer-list-jobs?view=graph-rest-beta#optional-query-parameters). 
- Filter print jobs by the user who created them, by applying a `$filter` [OData system query option](/graph/api/printer-list-jobs?view=graph-rest-beta#optional-query-parameters).

### Identity and access
Be able to include a [schedule](/graph/api/resources/requestschedule?view=graph-rest-beta) when requesting or removing an [assignment of a user to an access package](/graph/api/resources/accesspackageassignment?view=graph-rest-beta), that specifies access to groups, applications, or SharePoint sites.

### Teamwork
Get the date/time at which a Teams [channel](/graph/api/resources/channel?view=graph-rest-beta) or [team](/graph/api/resources/team?view=graph-rest-beta) is created.

## August 2020: New and generally available

### Change notifications
[Track changes](delta-query-overview.md) of supported resources in the Microsoft Graph for US Government national cloud.

### Cloud communications
- [Cancel](/graph/api/call-cancelmediaprocessing) any Interactive Voice Response (IVR) actions that are in process or in queue, that are either [playing an audio prompt](/graph/api/call-playprompt) or [recording a response](/graph/api/call-record).

### Teamwork
- Use an alternative way to [create a team](/graph/api/team-post) directly without first creating a group.

- Get the publishing status of a Microsoft Teams [app](/graph/api/resources/teamsapp) through the **publishingState** property of the [app definition](/graph/api/resources/teamsappdefinition). The possible status values are `submitted`, `published`, and `rejected`. See an [example](/graph/api/teamsapp-list?view=graph-rest-1.0&tabs=http#example-3-list-applications-with-a-given-id-and-return-the-submission-review-state).
- Use the `AppCatalog.Submit` delegated permission to allow a user to [submit an app](/graph/api/teamsapp-publish) and request administrator review. Use the same permission for a user to [cancel](/graph/api/teamsapp-delete) an app submitted in the past that has not been published. 


## August 2020: New in preview only

## Want to stay in the loop?

Here are some ways we can engage:

- Are there scenarios you'd like Microsoft Graph to support? Suggest and vote for new features at [Microsoft Graph User Voice](https://microsoftgraph.uservoice.com/forums/920506-microsoft-graph-feature-requests).
    Some new features originate as popular requests from the developer community. The Microsoft Graph team regularly evaluates customer needs and releases new features in the following order:

    1. Debut in **_preview_** status. Any related REST API updates are in the beta endpoint (`https://graph.microsoft.com/beta`).  

    2. Promoted to **_general availability_ (GA)** status, if sufficient feedback indicates viability. Any related REST API updates are added to the v1.0 endpoint (`https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0`). 
- Be an active member in the Microsoft Graph community! [Join](https://aka.ms/microsoftgraphcall) the monthly Microsoft Graph community call.
- Sign up for the [Microsoft 365 developer program](https://developer.microsoft.com/office/dev-program), get a free Microsoft 365 subscription, and start developing!
