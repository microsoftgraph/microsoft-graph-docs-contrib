### Compliance | eDiscovery
Continuing to fulfill the pipeline of [Microsoft 365 compliance APIs](/graph/api/resources/ediscoveryapioverview?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) are the [custodian](/graph/api/resources/custodian?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) resource and its related operations and methods to [release](/graph/api/custodian-release?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) or [activate](/graph/api/custodian-activate?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) a custodian. Use the **custodian** resource to access the custodian's data ([userSource](/graph/api/resources/userSource?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true)) in an Exchange Online mailbox and OneDrive for Business, SharePoint sites ([siteSource](/graph/api/resources/siteSource?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true)), and Microsoft 365 groups ([unifiedGroupSource](/graph/api/resources/unifiedGroupSource?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true)).

### Devices and apps | Cloud PC
Identify the failure status of a cloud-managed virtual desktop collectively as `failed`, in the **status** property of the [cloudPC](/graph/api/resources/cloudpc?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) resource.

### Devices and apps | Cloud printing
- [Update](/graph/api/printjob-update-configuration?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) the [configuration](/graph/api/resources/printjobconfiguration?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) of a [print job](/graph/api/resources/printjob?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true).
- For details on the renaming of a few properties and retyping of relationships, see the [December 2020](changelog.md#december-2020) section of the [API changelog](changelog.md) for details.

### Education
- If students are added after publishing the assignment, teachers can control the assignment behavior by using the **addedStudentAction** property of the [educationAssignment](/graph/api/resources/educationAssignment?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) resource.

Get or set the version and creation metadata for an Azure AD [terms of use](/graph/api/resources/agreement?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) [agreement](/graph/api/resources/agreement?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true), [agreement file](/graph/api/resources/agreementfile?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true), and [agreementfilelocalization](/graph/api/resources/agreementfilelocalization?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true).

### Identity and access | Governance
- As part of Azure Active Directory [entitlement management](/graph/api/resources/entitlementmanagement-root?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true), when users wishing to access groups, applications, or SharePoint Online sites request an assignment to an [access package](/graph/api/resources/accesspackage?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true), they can now respond to [questions](/graph/api/resources/accesspackagequestion?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) represented in [localized content](/graph/api/resources/accesspackagelocalizedcontent?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) in the [access package assignment request](/graph/api/resources/accesspackageassignmentrequest?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true).
- Use the [consent request APIs](/graph/api/resources/consentrequests-root?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) to manage the request workflow for users attempting to access apps that require access to organizational data.

### Identity and access | Identity and sign-in
- Administrators can associate user flows with apps that are shared with external users and enable [self-service sign-up](/azure/active-directory/external-identities/self-service-sign-up-overview) on those apps. They can customize a self-service sign-up user flow and create a personalized sign-up experience. Specifically, they create a [listener for a sign-up-start event to invoke a custom user flow](/graph/api/resources/invokeuserflowlistener?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true). Once an application is associated with the user flow, users who go to that application will be able to initiate a sign-up flow that provisions a guest account.
- In an [Azure Active Directory user flow](/graph/api/resources/b2xidentityuserflow?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) or [Azure Active Directory B2C tenant user flow](/graph/api/resources/b2cidentityuserflow?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true), you can manage language defaults and [customize the language and strings displayed to users in the user flow](/graph/api/resources/userflowlanguageconfiguration?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true).
- Use an [API connector](/graph/api/resources/identityapiconnector?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) in user flows for Azure AD self-service sign-up and Azure AD B2C sign-up, to call an API at a specific step to affect the execution of the user flow.
- Define an [email OTP authentication methods policy](/graph/api/resources/emailauthenticationmethodconfiguration?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) for a tenant.

### Teamwork
- For a [member](/graph/api/resources/conversationmember?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) resource in a [team](/graph/api/resources/team?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true), [channel](/graph/api/resources/channel?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true), or a [chat](/graph/api/resources/chat?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) context, you can now:
  - Differentiate a member who is an [Azure AD user](/graph/api/resources/aaduserconversationmember?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true), noting the user ID, email address, and Azure AD tenant ID. 
  - [Add multiple users as members of a team](/graph/api/conversationmembers-add?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true).
- For a [chat](/graph/api/resources/chat?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) resource:
  - [Get all the messages in chats that the specified user has participated in](/graph/api/chats-getallmessages?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true), including one-on-one chats, group chats, and meeting chats.
  - Use the full range of functionality to list, get, add, remove, and update an [app](/graph/api/resources/teamsappinstallation?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) or a [tab](/graph/api/resources/teamstab?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) in a chat.
  - Use the **chatType** property to distinguish a one-on-one chat from a group chat or from a chat associated with an online meeting.
  - [Create](/graph/api/chat-post?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) or [update](/graph/api/chat-patch?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) a chat.
  - For a member in a chat context, use the **visibleHistoryStartDateTime** property to set or get a timestamp that represents how far back a conversation's history is shared with that member.
  - [Create](/graph/api/chat-post-members?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) to or [delete](/graph/api/chat-delete-members?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) a member from a specified chat. 
- For a [channel](/graph/api/resources/channel?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) resource:
  - [Get all the messages across all the channels in a team](/graph/api/channels-getallmessages?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true).
  - Team owners can turn on [moderation for a channel](/graph/api/resources/channelmoderationsettings?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) to control who can start new posts or reply to posts in that channel, using the **moderationSettings** property of the channel.
- As part of a [Teams app definition](/graph/api/resources/teamsappdefinition?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true), use the **bot** relationship to connect to a [teamwork bot](/graph/api/resources/teamworkbot?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true).

### To-do tasks
Subscribe to [change notifications](webhooks.md) of a [To Do task](/graph/api/resources/todoTask?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true).

## November 2020: New and generally available

  - [Outlook calendar events](/graph/search-concept-events)
  - [OneDrive and SharePoint resources](/graph/search-concept-files).

- GA of APIs that apply to a [channel](/graph/api/resources/channel) or messages within a channel. The APIs include:
