# What's new in Microsoft Graph

See highlights of what's new in the recent two months in Microsoft Graph, [what's added earlier](whats-new-earlier.md), and how you can [share your ideas](#want-to-stay-in-the-loop). For a detailed list of API-level updates, see the [API changelog](changelog.md). 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Features, including APIs and tools, in _preview_ status may change without notice, and some may never be promoted to generally available (GA) status. Do not use preview features in production apps.

## November 2020: New and generally available

### Teamwork
- GA of resource-specific consent (RSC) permissions. RSC permissions allow team owners to grant granular consent to a production app to access and/or modify specific data of a team, for example, reading the team's settings, or modifying channel names, descriptions, and other settings.
- GA of APIs that apply to a [channel](/graph/api/resources/channel) or messages within a channel. The APIs include:
  - [Create](/graph/api/conversationmember-add) or [delete](/graph/api/conversationmember-delete) a conversation member from a channel.
  - [Update the role of a member](/graph/api/conversationmember-update) in a channel.
  - Get a specific message or all messages in a channel.
  - Get a specific reply or all replies in a channel.
  - [Track new or updated messages in a channel](/graph/api/chatmessage-delta).

### Search
- [Microsoft Search query](/graph/api/resources/search-api-overview) API in Graph is GA.
- GA of the query API applies to 
  - email [messages](/graph/search-concept-messsages),
  - calendar [events](/graph/search-concept-events) ,
  - content in [OneDrive and SharePoint](/graph/search-concept-files).


## November 2020: New in preview only

### Devices and apps | Cloud printing
[Subscribe to change notifications](webhooks.md) on a [print task definition](/graph/api/resources/printtaskdefinition?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true).

### Search
You can aggregate numeric or string type search results that are imported by [Microsoft Graph connectors](/microsoftsearch/connectors-overview) and that are set to be refinable in the [schema](/graph/api/resources/schema?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true). See more information about [refining search results using aggregations](search-concept-aggregation.md).

## October 2020: New and generally available

### Application
- Allow [email as an alternate login ID to Azure AD](/azure/active-directory/authentication/howto-authentication-use-email-signin), using a [Home Realm Discovery](/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/configure-authentication-for-federated-users-portal#home-realm-discovery) policy. A Home Realm Discovery policy determines after a user provides a sign-in ID, whether to prompt the user to authenticate. In this case, setting the **AlternateIdLogin** property of a [homeRealmDiscoveryPolicy](/graph/api/resources/homerealmdiscoverypolicy) resource can enable a user to sign in with an email address.
- Get the verified publisher information for an [application](/graph/api/resources/application) or [servicePrincipal](/graph/api/resources/serviceprincipal), and [set](/graph/api/application-setverifiedpublisher) or [remove](/graph/api/application-unsetverifiedpublisher) verified publisher information for an **application**.

### Change notifications
Production apps can now subscribe to lifecycle notifications of Outlook [message](/graph/api/resources/message), [event](/graph/api/resources/event), and [contact](/graph/api/resources/contact), and Teams [chatMessage](/graph/api/resources/chatmessage), in order to [reduce missing subscriptions and change notifications](webhooks-lifecycle.md).

### Identity and access
- GA of advanced OData system query options (`$count`, `$search`, and `$filter`) on directory objects.
- Check out examples that show OData cast on directory objects.
- See the Identity and access section of the [October](changelog.md#october-2020) updates in the changelog for the lists of enhanced APIs.

### Teamwork
- GA of the full set of CRUD operations for [conversationMember](/graph/api/resources/conversationmember) and [aadUserConversationMember](/graph/api/resources/aaduserconversationmember). These resources represent a member in a chat or channel conversation, who may or may not be a user in Azure AD.
- GA of lifecycle notifications for Teams [chatMessage](/graph/api/resources/chatmessage) resources, to [reduce missing subscriptions and change notifications](webhooks-lifecycle.md).

### To-do tasks
GA of the [Microsoft To Do API](/graph/api/resources/todo-overview?view=graph-rest-1.0&preserve-view=true) - use the to-do API in a production app to create and manage tasks that are part of a user's workflow, such as creating a task off an email.  

### Users
Get new properties applicable to a [user](/graph/api/resources/user) who is corporate employee: hire date, organizational association such as division and cost center, and employee type such as consultant, contractor, or vendor. These properties require specifying the `$select` OData query parameter in the GET operation.

## October 2020: New in preview only

### Cloud communications | Online meeting
- Distinguish the role of a participant in an [online meeting](/graph/api/resources/onlinemeeting?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) as an attendee or presenter, by using the **role** property of the [meetingParticipantInfo](/graph/api/resources/meetingParticipantInfo?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) type.
- Get an [onlineMeeting](/graph/api/resources/onlinemeeting?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) by [filtering on the joinWebUrl property of the meeting](/graph/api/onlinemeeting-get?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true#example-3-retrieve-an-online-meeting-by-joinweburl).

### Devices and apps | Cloud printing

- Deprecate the **uploadData** action in favor of [creating an upload session](/graph/api/printdocument-createuploadsession?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) to [upload a document](upload-data-to-upload-session.md) to a printer or printer share.
- Deprecate the **configuration** property on [printDocument](/graph/api/resources/printdocument?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) in favor of a similar **configuration** property on [printJob](/graph/api/resources/printjob?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true).
- Get the source or destination job URL for a **printJob** that is being redirected, by using the **redirectedFrom** or **redirectedTo** property.
- Get the current status of a **printJob** by using the **state** property and new **details** property.
- Get the collection of printer shares associated with a [printer](/graph/api/resources/printer?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) by using the **shares** relationship. 
- Deprecate the **processingStateReasons** property of **printer** in favor of the **status** property. The **status** property is of the type [printer status](/graph/api/resources/printerstatus?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) and exposes a **details** property. Use the **details** property to identify the reason for a printer to be in the current state.
- Deprecate the **feedDirections** property on [printerCapabilities](/graph/api/resources/printercapabilities?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) in favor of the **feedOrientations** property, to get feed orientations supported by a printer.
- See the cloud printing section of the [October](changelog.md#october-2020) updates in the changelog for a few renaming of API and properties, and a few other deprecations.

### Devices and apps | Corporate management
Intune [October](changelog.md#october-2020) updates for the beta version.

### Files
[Revoke](/graph/api/permission-revokegrants?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) access to a [listItem](/graph/api/resources/listitem?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) or [driveItem](/graph/api/resources/driveitem?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) granted via a sharing link.

### Identity and access | Identity and sign-in
- Manage [authentication method policies](/graph/api/resources/authenticationmethodspolicies-overview?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) to identify users who can use specific multi-factor authentication methods to sign into Azure Active Directory. Configure policies to define the following:
  - The types of FIDO2 security keys that can be used in the Azure AD tenant.
  - The users or groups of users who are allowed to use FIDO2 Security Keys or Passwordless Phone Sign-in to sign in to Azure AD.
- Configure an [email authentication method](/graph/api/resources/emailauthenticationmethod?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) for users to self-serve password resets.
- Use [Azure AD B2C](/azure/active-directory-b2c/overview) and [choose a mechanism to configure and let end users authenticate via local accounts](/graph/api/resources/b2cauthenticationmethodspolicy?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true).
- Use `Policy.ReadWrite.AuthenticationMethod` to read or write an organization's authentication method policies, as a delegated permission on behalf of a signed-in user, or as an application permission without a signed-in user present.
- Specify in an [authorization policy](/graph/api/resources/authorizationpolicy?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) if and who can invite external users to an organization.

### People and workplace intelligence | Insights 
Administrators can see [examples of using PowerShell cmdlets](insights-customize-item-insights-privacy.md#how-to-configure-item-insights-setting-via-powershell) to customize item insight settings for an organization.

### Teamwork
- Use the instance attribute **channelCreationMode** to indicate that a [channel](https://docs.microsoft.com/graph/api/resources/channel?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true#instance-attributes) is being created to serve migration of data. Use the [completeMigration](/graph/api/channel-completemigration?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) to indicate migration is over, such that members can post and read messages.
- Use the instance attribute **teamCreationMode** to indicate that a [team](https://docs.microsoft.com/graph/api/resources/team?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true#instance-attributes) is being created to serve migration. Use the [completeMigration](/graph/api/team-completemigration?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) to indicate migration is over, such that member operations can happen, and members can post messages.
