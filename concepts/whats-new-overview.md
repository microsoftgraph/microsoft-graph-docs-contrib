# What's new in Microsoft Graph

See highlights of what's new in the recent two months in Microsoft Graph, [what's added earlier](whats-new-earlier.md), and how you can [share your ideas](#want-to-stay-in-the-loop). For a detailed list of API-level updates, see the [API changelog](changelog.md). 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Features, including APIs and tools, in _preview_ status may change without notice, and some may never be promoted to generally available (GA) status. Do not use preview features in production apps.

## October 2020: New and generally available

### Change notifications
Production apps can now subscribe to lifecycle notifications of Outlook [message](/graph/api/resources/message), [event](/graph/api/resources/event), and [contact](/graph/api/resources/contact), and Teams [chatMessage](/graph/api/resources/chatmessage), in order to [reduce missing subscriptions and change notifications](webhooks-lifecycle.md).

### Identity and access
- GA of advanced OData system query options (`$count`, `$search`, and `$filter`) on directory objects.
- Check out examples that show OData cast on directory objects.
- See the Identity and access section of the [October](changelog.md#october-2020) updates in the changelog for the lists of enhanced APIs.

### Teamwork
- GA of the full set of CRUD operations for [conversationMember](/graph/api/resources/conversationmember) and [aadUserConversationMember](/graph/api/resources/aaduserconversationmember). These resources represent a member in a chat or channel conversation, who may or may not be a user in Azure AD.
- GA of lifecycle notifications for Teams [chatMessage](/graph/api/resources/chatmessage) resources, to [reduce missing subscriptions and change notifications](webhooks-lifecycle.md).

### To-do tasks
GA of the [Microsoft To Do API](/graph/api/resources/todo-overview?view=graph-rest-1.0&preserve-view=true) - use the to-do API in a production app to create and manage tasks that are part of a user's workflow, such as creating a task off an email.  

### Users
Get new properties applicable to a [user](/graph/api/resources/user) who is corporate employee: hire date, organizational association such as division and cost center, and employee type such as consultant, contractor, or vendor. These properties require specifying the `$select` OData query parameter in the GET operation.

- Get the current status of a **printJob** by using the **state** property and new **details** property.
- Get the collection of printer shares associated with a [printer](/graph/api/resources/printer?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) by using the **shares** relationship. 
- Deprecate the **processingStateReasons** property of **printer** in favor of the **status** property. The **status** property is of the type [printer status](/graph/api/resources/printerstatus?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) and exposes a **details** property. Use the **details** property to identify the reason for a printer to be in the current state.

- [Get notifications on changes](webhooks.md) in [chat messages](/graph/api/resources/chatmessage).
- [Update](/graph/api/chatmessage-update?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) the **policyViolation** property of a [chatMessage](/graph/api/resources/chatmessagepreserve-view=true) within a [channel](/graph/api/resources/channel&preserve-view=true) or [chat](/graph/api/resources/chat&preserve-view=true), enabling data loss prevention (DLP) apps to monitor [chat message policy violation](/graph/api/resources/chatmessagepolicyviolation?preserve-view=true) to prevent messages from containing data that users are not supposed to send.

### Use the SDKs
GA of the [Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/msgraph-sdk-powershell) which enables access to the entire surface of Microsoft Graph in a straightforward and consistent way.

### Use the Toolkit
Try the new step-by-step getting-started tutorials for Microsoft Graph Toolkit and experience the convenience the toolkit brings:
- [Build a web application in JavaScript](./toolkit/get-started/build-a-web-app.md)
- [Build a SharePoint web part](./toolkit/get-started/build-a-sharepoint-web-part.md)

## September 2020: New in preview only

### Application
Create, list, or delete [classifications of delegated permissions](/graph/api/resources/delegatedpermissionclassification?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) that a [service principal](/graph/api/resources/serviceprincipal?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) exposes. Use delegated permission classifications in combination with [user consent settings](/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/configure-user-consent) to set limits on when end-users are allowed to grant consent to apps.

### Cloud communications
- Deprecation of the **autoAdmittedUsers** property of [onlineMeeting](/graph/api/resources/onlinemeeting?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true). Instead, use the new **lobbyBypassSettings** property and its [values](/graph/api/resources/lobbybypasssettings?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true#lobbybypassscope-values).
- Use additional settings about announcing callers joining or leaving an online meeting (**isEntryExitAnnounced** property), and allowing specific presenters in the meeting (**allowedPresenters** property).

### Devices and apps | Cloud printing

- [Get a BitLocker recovery key](/graph/api/bitlockerrecoverykey-get?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) on behalf of the signed-in user who's the device owner or in an appropriate role. Getting a recovery key generates an [audit log](/azure/active-directory/reports-monitoring/concept-audit-logs), in parity with the end user experience.
- Get the total and used amount of the [directory quota](/graph/api/resources/directorysizequota?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) of an [organization](/graph/api/resources/organization?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true), through the **directorySizeQuota** property.

### Identity and access | Governance
Be able to include a [schedule](/graph/api/resources/requestschedule?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) when requesting or removing an [assignment of a user to an access package](/graph/api/resources/accesspackageassignment?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true), that specifies access to groups, applications, or SharePoint sites.

### Identity and access | Identity and sign-in

  - Get [additional types](/graph/api/resources/search-api-overview?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true#scope-search-based-on-entity-types) of content from OneDrive and SharePoint: **drive**, **list**, **listItem**, and **site**. 
  - Scope properties in search results to [selected properties](/graph/api/resources/search-api-overview?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true#get-selected-properties). 
  - Get custom properties on [listItem](/graph/api/resources/listitem?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) resources.
  - [Sort](/graph/api/resources/search-api-overview?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true#sort-search-results) search results for OneDrive and SharePoint on any sortable property.
  - [Refine results using aggregations](/graph/api/resources/search-api-overview?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true#refine-results-using-aggregations) for OneDrive and SharePoint.
- Query external data ingested by Microsoft Graph connectors across [more than one connection](./search-concept-custom-types.md).
- Take advantage of enhanced content for Microsoft Graph connectors to learn about:
  - [Managing connections](search-index-manage-connections.md)

External groups can represent non-Azure Active Directory groups or group-like constructs, such as business units, that determine permissions over the content in the external data source.

### Teamwork
- Get the date/time at which a Teams [channel](/graph/api/resources/channel?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) or [team](/graph/api/resources/team?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) is created.
