## May 2022: New and generally available

### Education
- [Track changes for assignment](/graph/api/educationassignment-delta) resources.

Allow an Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant to set up [federation with another organization whose identity provider (IdP) supports either the SAML or WS-Fed protocol](/graph/api/resources/samlOrWsFedExternalDomainFederation).

### Application

    Some new features originate as popular requests from the developer community. The Microsoft Graph team regularly evaluates customer needs and releases new features in the following order:

    1. Debut in **_preview_** status. Any related REST API updates are in the beta endpoint (`https://graph.microsoft.com/beta`).  

    2. Promoted to **_general availability_ (GA)** status, if sufficient feedback indicates viability. Any related REST API updates are added to the v1.0 endpoint (`https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0`). 
- Be an active member in the Microsoft Graph community! [Join](https://aka.ms/m365-dev-call) the weekly Microsoft 365 platform community call.
- Sign up for the [Microsoft 365 developer program](https://developer.microsoft.com/office/dev-program), get a free Microsoft 365 subscription, and start developing!
