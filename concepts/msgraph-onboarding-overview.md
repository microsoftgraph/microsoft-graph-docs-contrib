# Set up an EDU development environment

The education API in Microsoft Graph enhances Microsoft 365 resources with information that is relevant for education scenarios. To implement and test your education solutions, you need to set up a demo developer tenant.

You can create two types of developer tenants, depending on your needs:

- [Demo EDU development tenant](/graph/msgraph-onboarding-devtenant) - Use to develop and test education solutions that integrate with Microsoft Teams, School Data Sync, Immersive Reader, and more.
- [Demo EDU tenant](/graph/msgraph-onboarding-edutenant) - Provides a fully functional Microsoft 365 environment that you can use for customer demos and for personal development.

Before you set up your demo EDU tenant, you must join the [Microsoft Partner Network](/graph/msgraph-onboarding-mpn).
