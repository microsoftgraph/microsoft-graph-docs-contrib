# Get change notifications for Microsoft Teams virtual event updates

Change notifications in Microsoft Graph support subscriptions to virtual events. Change notifications provide a low-latency model by allowing you to maintain a webhook to Microsoft Teams virtual events. Virtual event subscriptions have a maximum period of a day. To extend the lifetime of a subscription, the subscription must be renewed before the expiry period. Alternatively, a user might decide to create a new subscription for the resource after the expiry of an existing subscription. For more information, see [Use the Microsoft Graph API to get change notifications](/graph/api/resources/webhooks).

## Subscribe to all events created in a tenant

You can specify subscriptions for all events of a unique app and tenant in the subscription payload by using the following syntax: `solutions/virtualEvents/events`. The subscription designates the notification URL to receive all event-created notifications in a tenant for virtual events. Only event-created notifications are supported for this subscription. A tenant can only have one type of subscription per application. User-delegated virtual event permissions are restricted from creating this type of subscription.

```http
POST https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/subscriptions
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "changeType": "created",
  "notificationUrl": "https://webhook.contoso.com/api",
  "lifecycleNotificationUrl": "https://webhook.contoso.com/api",

        "id": "solutions/virtualEvents/webinars/{webinarId}/sessions/{sessionId}"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Video on demand published

Events that are created when video-on-demand is published for a virtual event session. The application or user can use the **resourceData.@odata.id** property to discover which virtual event session video-on-demand is available.

When a notification is received for virtual event webinar sessions, the notification only informs the application or user that the video-on-demand URL for the virtual event webinar is published. The video-on-demand URL for the virtual event session might be null or usable only by the organizer. The application or user must determine which unique video-on-demand URLs to provide to different participants, as a single video-on-demand URL doesn't work for all users.

For virtual event town hall sessions, a universal video-on-demand URL is available on the virtual event session object, which can be used by all participants.

```json
{
  "value": [
    {
      "subscriptionId": "7015b436-a8b8-4260-af80-5af8cba32e62",
      "clientState": "secret client state",
      "changeType": "updated",
