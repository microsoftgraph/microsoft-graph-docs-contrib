# Configuring task rules in Planner (preview)

The Planner API in Microsoft Graph supports rules, which allow customization of what can and can't be done on tasks. Task rules can be specified for tasks created from various sources, such as [business scenarios](/graph/api/resources/businessscenario-planner-overview).

Task property rules are represented by the [plannerTaskPropertyRule](/graph/api/resources/plannertaskpropertyrule) entity and describe the allowed actions at the task-level and rules around each configurable property.

Depending on the specific entry, the rules specify either a collection of values or a [fieldRules](/graph/api/resources/plannerfieldrules) object. Field rules specify a collection of values as default, and provide a separate collection of values for override conditions. For any collection of values, the specified values are what is allowed; omitted values aren't allowed.

In this article, you will learn the behaviors associated with each entry and the override conditions supported by each property.

## Configurable actions

### delete

Specifies whether the task can be deleted. Accepted values are:

* `block`: Task can't be deleted.
* `allow`: Task can be deleted.

The collection must contain only one of these values.

### move

Specifies whether the task can be moved. This only includes a task moving between [buckets](/graph/api/resources/plannerbucket) and [plans](/graph/api/resources/plannerplan) with the same or different [containers](/graph/api/resources/plannerplancontainer). However, it doesn't include other operations similar to moves, which can be configured independently, such as assignments, ordering of the task, percent complete, or priority. Accepted values are:

* `block`: Task can't be moved.
* `moveBetweenBuckets`: Task can only be moved between the buckets of the plan it is in.
* `moveBetweenPlans`: Task can be moved between buckets and across the plans that belong to the same container.
* `allow`: Task can be moved between buckets and across plans.

The collection must contain only one of these values.

### order

Specifies whether the task can be reordered in shared views. Accepted values are:

* `block`: Task can't be reordered.
* `allow`: Task can be reordered.

The collection must contain only one of these values.

## Configurable properties

The collection must contain only one of these values.

This property doesn't support any override conditions. The rules must be specified in the **defaultRules** property.
