#Customer intent: As a developer, I want to understand how resources differ between Azure AD Graph and Microsoft Graph, so that I can update my code accordingly as I migrate my app from Azure AD Graph to Microsoft Graph.

# Differences between resources in Azure AD Graph and Microsoft Graph

> This article is part of *Step 1: review API differences* in the [Azure AD Graph app migration planning checklist](migrate-azure-ad-graph-planning-checklist.md) series.

When migrating apps from Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) Graph to Microsoft Graph, some resources have different names and different types. For example, if your Azure AD Graph app uses the **TenantDetail** resource, you need to update your code to refer to [organization](/graph/api/resources/organization) instead.

This article highlights differences between Azure AD Graph and Microsoft Graph resources. It shows resources that have different names or aren't available; it also highlights resources available in the `beta` version of Microsoft Graph but not in the `v1.0` version.

If a resource is **not** shown in this list, it's already available in the [v1.0 version](/graph/api/overview) of Microsoft Graph, with the same name as in Azure AD Graph.

> [!NOTE]
> Resource type names in Azure AD Graph are Pascal-cased, whereas in Microsoft Graph they're camel-cased.

In Azure AD Graph, the type was a single policy type. For example, for Azure AD Graph you would work with the **Policy** resource, and set the **type** property to `TokenIssuancePolicy`, while in Microsoft Graph the resource would be the **tokenIssuancePolicy** resource. |
