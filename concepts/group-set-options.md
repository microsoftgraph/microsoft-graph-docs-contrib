# Microsoft 365 Group behaviors and provisioning options

On the [group](/graph/api/resources/group) resource in Microsoft Graph, you can use the **resourceBehaviorOptions** property to set specific group behaviors when creating a Microsoft 365 group. The **resourceProvisioningOptions** property on the other hand indicates the specific resources provisioned for the group.

## Resource behavior options

**resourceBehaviorOptions** is a string collection that specifies group behaviors for a Microsoft 365 group. These behaviors can be set only on [group creation](/graph/api/group-post-groups).

| Supported values for resourceBehaviorOptions | Description                                                                                                                                     |
|:---------------------------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `AllowOnlyMembersToPost`                     | Only group _members_ can post conversations to the group; otherwise, any user in the organization can post conversations to the group.          |
| `CalendarMemberReadOnly`                     | Members can view the group calendar in Outlook but can't make changes; otherwise, members can both view and edit the group calendar in Outlook. |
| `ConnectorsDisabled`                         | Changes made to the group in Exchange Online aren't synced back to on-premises Active Directory.                                                |
| `HideGroupInOutlook`                         | This group is hidden in Outlook experiences; otherwise, the group is visible and discoverable in Outlook experiences.                           |
| `SubscribeMembersToCalendarEventsDisabled`   | Members aren't subscribed to the group's calendar events in Outlook.                                                                            |
| `SubscribeNewGroupMembers`                   | Group members are subscribed to receive group conversations.                                                                                    |
| `WelcomeEmailDisabled`                       | Welcome emails aren't sent to new members.                                                                                                      |
| `SkipExchangeInstantOn`                      | For internal use only. DO NOT USE.                                                                                                              |
