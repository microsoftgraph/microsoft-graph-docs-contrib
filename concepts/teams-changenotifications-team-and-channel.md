# Get change notifications for teams and channels using Microsoft Graph

Change notifications enable you to subscribe to changes (create, update, and delete) to teams and channels. You can get notified whenever a [team](/graph/api/resources/team) or [channel](/graph/api/resources/channel) is created, updated, or deleted. You can also get the resource data in the notifications and therefore avoid calling the API to get the payload.

Continue with this article about scenarios for the **team** or **channel** resource. Or, find out about [change notifications for other Microsoft Teams resources](teams-change-notification-in-microsoft-teams-overview.md).


## Subscribe to changes in any team at tenant level

To get change notifications for all changes (create, update, and delete) related to any team in a tenant, subscribe to `/teams`. This resource supports [including resource data](webhooks-with-resource-data.md) in the notification.

### Permissions

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) | Not supported. |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported.    |
|Application | Team.ReadBasic.All, TeamSettings.Read.All, TeamSettings.ReadWrite.All   |

### Example

```http
POST https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/subscriptions
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "changeType": "created,deleted,updated",
  "notificationUrl": "https://webhook.azurewebsites.net/api/resourceNotifications",
  "resource": "/teams",
  "includeResourceData": true,
  "encryptionCertificate": "{base64encodedCertificate}",
  "encryptionCertificateId": "{customId}",
  "expirationDateTime": "2019-09-19T11:00:00.0000000Z",
  "clientState": "{secretClientState}"
}
```

## Subscribe to changes in a particular team


To get change notifications for all changes related to a particular team in a tenant, subscribe to `/teams/{team-id}`. This resource supports [including resource data](webhooks-with-resource-data.md) in the notification.

### Permissions

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) | Team.ReadBasic.All, TeamSettings.Read.All, TeamSettings.ReadWrite.All |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported.    |
|Application | TeamSettings.Read.Group*, TeamSettings.ReadWrite.Group*, Team.ReadBasic.All, TeamSettings.Read.All, TeamSettings.ReadWrite.All    |

>**Note:** Permissions marked with * are supported as part of [resource-specific consent](/microsoftteams/platform/graph-api/rsc/resource-specific-consent).

### Example

```http
POST https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/subscriptions
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "changeType": "deleted,updated",
  "notificationUrl": "https://webhook.azurewebsites.net/api/resourceNotifications",
  "resource": "/teams/{team-id}",
  "includeResourceData": true,
  "encryptionCertificate": "{base64encodedCertificate}",
  "encryptionCertificateId": "{customId}",
  "expirationDateTime": "2019-09-19T11:00:00.0000000Z",
  "clientState": "{secretClientState}"
}
```


## Subscribe to changes in any channel at tenant level

To get change notifications for all changes (create, update, and delete) related to any [channel](/graph/api/resources/channel) in a tenant, subscribe to `/teams/getAllChannels`. This resource supports [including resource data](webhooks-with-resource-data.md) in the notification.

Continue with this article about scenarios for the [channel](/graph/api/resources/channel) or [chat](/graph/api/resources/chat) context. Or, find out about [change notifications for other Microsoft Teams resources](teams-change-notification-in-microsoft-teams-overview.md).



### Permissions

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) | Not supported. |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported.    |
|Application | Channel.ReadBasic.All, ChannelSettings.Read.All, ChannelSettings.ReadWrite.All |

### Example

```http
POST https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/subscriptions
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "changeType": "created,deleted,updated",
  "notificationUrl": "https://webhook.azurewebsites.net/api/resourceNotifications",

  "expirationDateTime": "2019-09-19T11:00:00.0000000Z",
  "clientState": "{secretClientState}"
}
```

## Subscribe to changes in any channel of a particular team


To get change notifications for all changes related to any channel in a particular team, subscribe to `/teams/{team-id}/channels`. This resource supports [including resource data](webhooks-with-resource-data.md) in the notification. Change notifications for private channels aren't supported in delegated context. In this case, a subscriber to this resource in delegated context will receive notifications only for standard channels under a particular team, not for private channels. Change notifications for shared channels aren't supported.


### Permissions

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) | Channel.ReadBasic.All, ChannelSettings.Read.All, ChannelSettings.ReadWrite.All |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported.    |
|Application | ChannelSettings.Read.Group*, ChannelSettings.ReadWrite.Group*, Channel.ReadBasic.All, ChannelSettings.Read.All, ChannelSettings.ReadWrite.All   |

>**Note:** Permissions marked with * are supported as part of [resource-specific consent](/microsoftteams/platform/graph-api/rsc/resource-specific-consent).

### Example

POST https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/subscriptions
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "changeType": "created,deleted,updated",
  "notificationUrl": "https://webhook.azurewebsites.net/api/resourceNotifications",
  "resource": "/teams/{team-id}/channels",
  "includeResourceData": true,
  "encryptionCertificate": "{base64encodedCertificate}",

  "expirationDateTime": "2019-09-19T11:00:00.0000000Z",
  "clientState": "{secretClientState}"
}
```


### Notifications with resource data

For notifications with resource data, the payload looks like the following. This payload is for a property change in a team.

```json
{
    "value": [{
        "subscriptionId": "10493aa0-4d29-4df5-bc0c-ef742cc6cd7f",
        "changeType": "created",
        "clientState": "<<--SpecifiedClientState-->>",
        "subscriptionExpirationDateTime": "2021-02-02T10:30:34.9097561-08:00",
        "resource": "teams('fb82c19a-0f6d-41ed-90f0-cbb29a476ede')",
        "resourceData": {
            "id": "1612289765949",
            "@odata.type": "#Microsoft.Graph.Team",
            "@odata.id": "teams('fb82c19a-0f6d-41ed-90f0-cbb29a476ede')"
        },
        "encryptedContent": {
            "data": "<<--EncryptedContent-->",
            "dataKey": "<<--EnryptedDataKeyUsedForEncryptingContent-->>",
            "encryptionCertificateId": "<<--IdOfTheCertificateUsedForEncryptingDataKey-->>",
            "encryptionCertificateThumbprint": "<<--ThumbprintOfTheCertificateUsedForEncryptingDataKey-->>"
        },
        "tenantId": "<<--TenantForWhichNotificationWasSent-->>"
    }],
    "validationTokens": ["<<--ValidationTokens-->>"]
}
```



The decrypted notification payload looks like the following. The payload conforms to the [teams](/graph/api/resources/team?preserve-view=true) schema. The payload is similar to that returned by GET operations.

>**Note:** [discoverySettings](/graph/api/resources/teamdiscoverysettings?preserve-view=true) and [classSettings](/graph/api/resources/teamclasssettings?preserve-view=true) aren't exposed in payload data.

  "id": "19:a3f841d969cd4ae0a7cbe847fc10b371@thread.tacv2",

  "membershipType": "standard",
  "moderationSettings": null
}
```


### Notifications without resource data

Notifications without resource data give you enough information to make GET calls to get the message content. Subscriptions for notifications without resource data don't require an encryption certificate (because actual resource data is not sent over).

For notifications without resource data, the payload looks like the following. This payload is for a property change in a team.

```json
{
  "subscriptionId": "9f9d1ed0-c9cc-42e7-8d80-a7fc4b0cda3c",
  "changeType": "created",
  "tenantId": "<<--TenantForWhichNotificationWasSent-->>",
  "clientState": "<<--SpecifiedClientState-->>",
  "subscriptionExpirationDateTime": "2021-02-02T11:26:41.0537895-08:00",
  "resource": "teams('fbe2bf47-16c8-47cf-b4a5-4b9b187c508b')",
  "resourceData": {
    "id": "1612293113399",
    "@odata.type": "#Microsoft.Graph.Teams",
    "@odata.id": "teams('fbe2bf47-16c8-47cf-b4a5-4b9b187c508b')"
  }
}
```

The **resource** and **@odata.id** properties can be used to make calls to Microsoft Graph to get the payload for the message. GET calls will always return the current state of the message. If the message is changed between when the notification is sent and when the message is retrieved, the operation will return the updated message.


>**Note:** Channel email address isn't returned in the payload.

For notifications without resource data, the payload looks like the following. This payload is for a property change in a team.

```json
{
  "id": "19:a3f841d969cd4ae0a7cbe847fc10b371@thread.tacv2",
  "createdDateTime": "2020-02-14T01:10:03.592Z",
  "displayName": "General",
  "description": "Sample Channel description",
  "isFavoriteByDefault": true,
  "email": "",
  "webUrl": "https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3Aa3f841d969cd4ae0a7cbe847fc10b371%40thread.tacv2/General?groupId=7ed9bdab-9c7d-4c10-a25d-3f4ff0e34577&tenantId=0f2d8f49-862a-493b-9ca8-82a10637e17d",
  "membershipType": "standard",
  "moderationSettings": null
}
```
