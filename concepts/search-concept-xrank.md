# Use the Microsoft Search API to xrank search results

You can use the Microsoft Search API **XRANK** expression in Microsoft Graph to boost the dynamic rank of items based on certain term occurrences within the match expression, without changing which items match the query. An **XRANK** expression contains one component that must be matched, *the match expression*, and one or more components that contribute only to dynamic ranking, *the rank expression*. At least one of the parameters, excluding n, must be specified for an XRANK expression to be valid. The xrank operator is only supported on files hosted in SharePoint.

You can use the **XRANK** operator in the following syntax:
```HTTP
<match expression> XRANK(cb=100, rb=0.4, pb=0.4, avgb=0.4, stdb=0.4, nb=0.4, n=200) <rank expression>
```

For more information about the dynamic ranking calculation of the XRANK operator, see [Dynamic ranking operator](/sharepoint/dev/general-development/keyword-query-language-kql-syntax-reference#dynamic-ranking-operator).

## Example
The following example shows a request that searches for files hosted in SharePoint and uses the **XRANK operator** to boost specified search results.
