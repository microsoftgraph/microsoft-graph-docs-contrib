# Get change notifications for change in teams membership using Microsoft Graph

Change notifications enable you to subscribe to changes (create, update, and delete) to [membership](/graph/api/resources/conversationmember?preserve-view=true) in a [team](/graph/api/resources/team?preserve-view=true). Change notifications provide a low latency model by allowing you to maintain a [subscription](/graph/api/resources/webhooks?preserve-view=true). You can also get the resource data in the notifications and therefore avoid calling the API to get the payload.

>**Note:** The maximum time a subscription can last is 60 minutes; however, subscriptions can be renewed until the caller has permissions to access to resource.




### Subscribe to changes in membership of a particular team

To get change notifications for membership change in any team in tenant, subscribe to `teams/{id}/members`. This resource supports [including resource data](webhooks-with-resource-data.md) in the notification.

#### Permissions

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              | Supported versions |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|:-------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) | Not supported. | Not supported. |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported.    | Not supported. |
|Application | TeamMember.Read   | beta, v1.0 |

#### Example

```http
POST https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/subscriptions
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "changeType": "created,deleted,updated",
  "notificationUrl": "https://webhook.azurewebsites.net/api/resourceNotifications",
  "resource": "/teams/{id}/members ",
  "includeResourceData": true,
  "encryptionCertificate": "{base64encodedCertificate}",
  "encryptionCertificateId": "{customId}",
  "expirationDateTime": "2019-09-19T11:00:00.0000000Z",
  "clientState": "{secretClientState}"
}
```


## Notification payloads

Depending on your subscription, you can either get the notification with resource data, or without it. Subscribing with resource data allows you to get the message payload along with the notification, removing the need to call back and get the content.

### Notifications with resource data

For notifications with resource data, the payload looks like the following. This payload is for a membership change in a team.

```json
TBD-- JSON is wrong.
{
    "value": [{
        "subscriptionId": "10493aa0-4d29-4df5-bc0c-ef742cc6cd7f",
        "changeType": "created",
        "clientState": "<<--SpecifiedClientState-->>",
        "subscriptionExpirationDateTime": "2021-02-02T10:30:34.9097561-08:00",
        "resource": "chats('19:8ea0e38b-efb3-4757-924a-5f94061cf8c2_97f62344-57dc-409c-88ad-c4af14158ff5@unq.gbl.spaces')/messages('1612289765949')",
        "resourceData": {
            "id": "1612289765949",
            "@odata.type": "#Microsoft.Graph.chatMessage",
            "@odata.id": "chats('19:8ea0e38b-efb3-4757-924a-5f94061cf8c2_97f62344-57dc-409c-88ad-c4af14158ff5@unq.gbl.spaces')/messages('1612289765949')"
        },
        "encryptedContent": {
            "data": "<<--EncryptedContent-->",
            "dataKey": "<<--EnryptedDataKeyUsedForEncryptingContent-->>",
            "encryptionCertificateId": "<<--IdOfTheCertificateUsedForEncryptingDataKey-->>",
            "encryptionCertificateThumbprint": "<<--ThumbprintOfTheCertificateUsedForEncryptingDataKey-->>"
        },
        "tenantId": "<<--TenantForWhichNotificationWasSent-->>"
    }],
    "validationTokens": ["<<--ValidationTokens-->>"]
}
```

For details about how to validate tokens and decrypt the payload, see [Set up change notifications that include resource data](webhooks-with-resource-data.md).

The decrypted notification payload looks like the following. The payload conforms to the [aaduserconversationmember](/graph/api/resources/aaduserconversationmember?preserve-view=true) schema. The payload is similar to that returned by GET operations.

```json
{
  "id": "/ZWUwZjVhZTItOGJjNi00YWU1LTg0NjYtN2RhZWViYmZhMDYyIyM3Mzc2MWYwNi0yYWM5LTQ2OWMtOWYxMC0yNzlhOGNjMjY3Zjk=",
  "roles": [
    "owner"
  ],
  "displayName": "John Doe",
  "userId": "8b081ef6-4792-4def-b2c9-c363a1bf41d5",
  "email": null
}
```

### Notifications without resource data

Notifications without resource data give you enough information to make GET calls to get the message content. Subscriptions for notifications without resource data do not require an encryption certificate (because actual resource data is not sent over).

For notifications without resource data, the payload  for any change in team's membership looks like the following.

```json
TBD-- this json is wrong
 {
  "subscriptionId": "9f9d1ed0-c9cc-42e7-8d80-a7fc4b0cda3c",
  "changeType": "created",
  "tenantId": "<<--TenantForWhichNotificationWasSent-->>",
  "clientState": "<<--SpecifiedClientState-->>",
  "subscriptionExpirationDateTime": "2021-02-02T11:26:41.0537895-08:00",
  "resource": "teams('fbe2bf47-16c8-47cf-b4a5-4b9b187c508b')/channels('19:4a95f7d8db4c4e7fae857bcebe0623e6@thread.tacv2')/messages('1612293113399')",
  "resourceData": {
    "id": "1612293113399",
    "@odata.type": "#Microsoft.Graph.chatMessage",
    "@odata.id": "teams('fbe2bf47-16c8-47cf-b4a5-4b9b187c508b')/channels('19:4a95f7d8db4c4e7fae857bcebe0623e6@thread.tacv2')/messages('1612293113399')"
  }
}
```

The **resource** and **@odata.id** properties can be used to make calls to Microsoft Graph to get the payload for the message. GET calls will always return the current state of the message. If the message is changed between when the notification is sent and when the message is retrieved, the operation will return the updated message.
