> [!NOTE]
> Many resources have limits or quotas on how many subscriptions can be made against that resource.  When exceeding that limit, attempts to create a subscription will result in a `403 Forbidden` error response. The **message** property of the error response will explain the limit that has been exceeded.

Some of these resources support rich notifications (notifications with resource data). For more information about resources that support rich notifications, see [Set up change notifications that include resource data](/graph/webhooks-with-resource-data#supported-resources).
