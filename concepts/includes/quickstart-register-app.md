#Customer intent: As developer, I want to know how to register my client application with the Microsoft identity platform so it can be authorized to access data in the Microsoft cloud.

For your app to use the identity and access management (IAM) capabilities of Microsoft Entra ID, including accessing protected resources, you must register it first. Then the Microsoft identity platform performs the IAM functions for the registered applications. This article shows you how to register a *web application* in the Microsoft Entra admin center. You can learn more about [app types you can register in the Microsoft identity platform](/entra/identity-platform/v2-app-types).

> [!TIP]
> To register an application for Azure AD B2C, follow the steps in [Tutorial: Register a web application in Azure AD B2C](/azure/active-directory-b2c/tutorial-register-applications).

## Prerequisites

- A Microsoft Entra ID tenant. If you don't have a tenant, create a [free Azure account to get free subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account).
- An account that has at least the [Cloud Application Administrator](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference?toc=%2Fgraph%2Ftoc.json#cloud-application-administrator) role.

## Register an application

Registering your application establishes a trust relationship between your app and the Microsoft identity platform. The trust is unidirectional: your app trusts the Microsoft identity platform, and not the other way around. Once created, the application object can't be moved between different tenants.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com).
1. If you have access to multiple tenants, use the **Settings** icon in the top menu to switch to the tenant in which you want to register the application from the **Directories + subscriptions** menu.
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **App registrations** and select **New registration**.
1. Enter a display **Name** for your application.
1. Specify who can use the application in the **Supported account types** section.

   | Supported account types                                                      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

1. Don't enter anything for **Redirect URI (optional)**. You'll configure a redirect URI in the next section.
1. Select **Register** to complete the initial app registration.

When registration finishes, the Microsoft Entra admin center displays the app registration's **Overview** pane. On this page, the app was assigned values for:

- **Application (client) ID** which uniquely identifies your application in the Microsoft cloud ecosystem, across all tenants.
- **Object ID** which uniquely identifies your application in your tenant.

## Configure platform settings

Platform settings include redirect URIs, specific authentication settings, or fields specific to the application's platform, for example, **Web** and **Single-page applications**.

1. Under **Manage**, select **Authentication**.
1. Under **Platform configurations**, select **Add a platform**.
1. Under **Configure platforms**, select the tile for your application type (platform) to configure its settings.

Also select this platform for desktop applications. |

1. Select **Configure** to complete the platform configuration.

### Redirect URI restrictions

There are some restrictions on the format of the redirect URIs you add to an app registration. For details about these restrictions, see [Redirect URI (reply URL) restrictions and limitations](/entra/identity-platform/reply-url).

## Add credentials

Credentials are used by [confidential client applications](/entra/identity-platform/msal-client-applications) that access a web API. Examples of confidential clients are web apps, other web APIs, or service-type and daemon-type applications. Credentials allow your application to authenticate as itself, requiring no interaction from a user at runtime.

You can add certificates, client secrets (a string or password), or federated credentials as credentials to your confidential client app registration.

:::image type="content" source="../images/quickstart-register-app/portal-05-app-reg-04-credentials.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Microsoft Entra admin center, showing the Certificates and secrets pane in an app registration.":::

### Option 1: Add a certificate

Sometimes called a _public key_, a certificate is the recommended credential type because they're considered more secure than client secrets. For more information about using a certificate as an authentication method in your application, see [Microsoft identity platform application authentication certificate credentials](/entra/identity-platform/certificate-credentials).

1. Select **Certificates & secrets** > **Certificates** > **Upload certificate**.
1. Select the file you want to upload. It must be one of the following file types: _.cer_, _.pem_, _.crt_.
1. Select **Add**.

### Option 2: Add a client secret

Sometimes called an _application password_, a client secret is a string value your app can use in place of a certificate to identity itself.

Client secrets are considered less secure than certificate credentials. Application developers sometimes use client secrets during local app development because of their ease of use. However, you should use either certificate credentials or federated credentials for applications that are running in production.

1. Select **Certificates & secrets** > **Client secrets** > **New client secret**.
1. Add a description for your client secret.
1. Select an expiration for the secret or specify a custom lifetime.
    - Client secret lifetime is limited to two years (24 months) or less. You can't specify a custom lifetime longer than 24 months.
    - Microsoft recommends that you set an expiration value of less than 12 months.
1. Select **Add**.
1. _Record the secret's value_ for use in your client application code. This secret value is _never displayed again_ after you leave this page.

For application security recommendations, see [Microsoft identity platform best practices and recommendations](/entra/identity-platform/identity-platform-integration-checklist#security).

If you're using an Azure DevOps service connection that automatically creates a service principal, you need to update the client secret from the Azure DevOps portal site instead of directly updating the client secret. Refer to this document on how to update the client secret from the Azure DevOps portal site:
[Troubleshoot Azure Resource Manager service connections](/azure/devops/pipelines/release/azure-rm-endpoint#service-principals-token-expired).

### Option 3: Add a federated credential

Federated credentials are a type of credential that allows workloads, such as GitHub Actions, workloads running on Kubernetes, or workloads running in compute platforms outside of Azure, to access Microsoft Entra ID-protected resources without needing to manage secrets. Federated credentials use [workload identity federation](/entra/workload-id/workload-identity-federation).

To add a federated credential, follow these steps:

1. Select **Certificates & secrets** > **Federated credentials** > **Add credential**.
1. In the **Federated credential scenario** drop-down box, select one of the supported scenarios, and follow the corresponding guidance to complete the configuration.

   - **Customer managed keys** for encrypt data in your tenant using Azure Key Vault in another tenant.
   - **GitHub actions deploying Azure resources** to [configure a GitHub workflow](/entra/workload-id/workload-identity-federation-create-trust?pivots=identity-wif-apps-methods-azp#github-actions) to get tokens for your application and deploy assets to Azure.
   - **Kubernetes accessing Azure resources** to configure a [Kubernetes service account](/entra/workload-id/workload-identity-federation-create-trust?pivots=identity-wif-apps-methods-azp#kubernetes) to get tokens for your application and access Azure resources.
   - **Other issuer** to configure an identity managed by an external [OpenID Connect provider](/entra/workload-id/workload-identity-federation-create-trust?pivots=identity-wif-apps-methods-azp#other-identity-providers) to get tokens for your application and access Azure resources.
    
For more information about how to get an access token with a federated credential, see [Microsoft identity platform and the OAuth 2.0 client credentials flow](/entra/identity-platform/v2-oauth2-client-creds-grant-flow#third-case-access-token-request-with-a-federated-credential).
