#customer intent: As a developer, I want to use the access reviews API to automate the auditing of guest access to Microsoft 365 groups so that I can streamline compliance processes.

# Review guest access to groups using access reviews APIs

The access reviews API in Microsoft Graph enables organizations to audit and attest to the access that identities (also called *principals*) are assigned to resources in the organization. With B2B collaboration, you can use Microsoft 365 groups to efficiently manage access for guests to resources such as files, notes, calendars, and even Teams conversations. And by using the access reviews API, organizations can periodically attest to principals that have access to such groups and by extension, other resources in the organization.

In this tutorial, you learn how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Create a recurring access review of Microsoft 365 groups with guests.
> * Investigate the decisions that are applied to access reviews.

## Prerequisites

To complete this tutorial, you need the following resources and privileges:

+ A working Microsoft Entra tenant with a Microsoft Entra ID P2 or Microsoft Entra ID Governance license enabled. 
+ A test guest and a test Microsoft 365 group in your tenant. The guest should be a member of the Microsoft 365 group.
+ Sign in to an API client such as [Graph Explorer](https://aka.ms/ge) to call Microsoft Graph with an account that has at least the *Identity Governance Administrator* role.
+ Grant yourself the following delegated permissions: `AccessReview.ReadWrite.All`.

## Step 1: Create an access review for all Microsoft 365 groups with guests

The following access review series uses these settings:
+ It's a recurring access review and reviewed quarterly.
+ The group owners are the decision makers.
+ The review scope is limited to only Microsoft 365 groups with guests.
+ It defines a user as the fallback reviewer who can review the access in case the group doesn't have any owners assigned.
+ **autoApplyDecisionsEnabled** is set to `true`. In this case, decisions are applied automatically once the reviewer completes the access review or the access review duration ends. If not enabled, a user must apply the decisions manually after the review completes.
+ **applyActions** is set to `removeAccessApplyAction`. This action removes denied guests from the group. The guest can still sign in to your tenant, but won't be members of the group or have the access privileges that are granted through the group.

### Request

In this call, replace these values:

+ `c9a5aff7-9298-4d71-adab-0a222e0a05e4` with the ID of the fallback reviewer.
+ Value of **startDate** with today's date and value of **endDate** with a date one year from the start date.

## Step 2: List instances of the access review

The following query lists all instances of the access review definition. If there is more than one Microsoft 365 group with guests in your tenant, this request returns *one instance for each group*.

### Response

In this response, the scope includes the test group because it has a guest. The access review instance is currently `InProgress`. Because it's a quarterly review, a new review instance is created automatically every three months, and the reviewers can apply new decisions.

}
```

## Step 3: Get decisions

Get the decisions for the instance of an access review. In a quarterly review like this one, and as long as the access review is active:
+ A new review instance is created every three months.
+ Reviewers must apply new decisions for new instances.

        }
    ]
}
```

## Step 4: Clean up resources

In this step, delete the access review definition. Since the access review schedule definition is the blueprint for the access review, deleting the definition removes the related settings, instances, and decisions. The request returns a `204 No Content` response.
