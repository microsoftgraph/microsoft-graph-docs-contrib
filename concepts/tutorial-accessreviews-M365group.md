# Review guest access to your Microsoft 365 groups using the access reviews API in Microsoft Graph

The access reviews API in Microsoft Graph enables organizations to audit and attest to the access that identities (also called *principals*) are assigned to resources in the organization. In cross-tenant collaboration, external users can have access resources such as files, notes, calendars, and even Teams conversations. This access can be efficiently managed through Microsoft 365 groups. Using the access reviews API, organizations can therefore periodically attest to principals that have access to such groups and by extension, other resources in the organization.

Let's assume that you've granted access to external users (also called *guest users*) to resources in your organization through Microsoft 365 groups. This tutorial will guide you to review their access to the Microsoft 365 groups in your tenant.

>[!NOTE]
>The response objects shown in this tutorial might be shortened for readability.

## Prerequisites

To complete this tutorial, you need the following resources and privileges:

+ A working Azure AD tenant with an Azure AD Premium P2 or EMS E5 license enabled. 
+ An account in a different Azure AD tenant or a social identity that you can invite as a guest user (B2B user).
+ Sign in to an API client such as [Graph Explorer](https://aka.ms/ge), Postman, or create your own client app to call Microsoft Graph. To call Microsoft Graph APIs in this tutorial, you need to use an account with the Global Administrator role.
+ Grant yourself the following delegated permissions: `User.Invite.All`, `AccessReview.ReadWrite.All`, `Group.ReadWrite.All`, `User.ReadWrite.All`.

## Step 1: Create a test user in your tenant

## Step 3: Create a new Microsoft 365 group and add the guest user

In this step:
1. Create a new Microsoft 365 group named **Feel good marketing campaign**.
2. Assign yourself as the group owner.
3. Add john@tailspintoys.com as a group member. Their access to the group is the subject of review by you, the group owner.

### Request

In this call, replace:

    ]
}
```

You now have a Microsoft 365 group with a guest user.

## Step 4: Create an access review for all Microsoft 365 groups with guest users

When you create a recurring access review series for all Microsoft 365 groups with guest users, you schedule a periodic review of the guests' access to the Microsoft 365 group. In this case, the **Feel good Marketing Campaign** group.

The access review series uses following settings:
+ It's a recurring access review and reviewed quarterly.
+ The group owners decide whether guest users should maintain their access.
+ The review scope is limited to only Microsoft 365 groups with **guest users**.
+ A backup reviewer. They can be a fallback user or a group that can review the access in case the group doesn't have any owners assigned.
+ **autoApplyDecisionsEnabled** is set to `true`. In this case, decisions are applied automatically once the reviewer completes the access review or the access review duration ends. If not enabled, a user must apply the decisions manually after the review completes.
+ Apply the **removeAccessApplyAction** action to denied guest users to remove them from the group. The guest user can still sign in to your tenant, but won't access the group.

### Request

In this call, replace the following values:

+ `c9a5aff7-9298-4d71-adab-0a222e0a05e4` with the ID of Aline who you're designating as a backup reviewer.
+ Value of **startDate** with today's date and value of **endDate** with a date one year from the start date.

## Step 5: List instances of the access review

The following query lists all instances of the access review definition. If there are more than one Microsoft 365 groups with guest users in your tenant, this request will return *one instance for every Microsoft 365 group with guest users*.

### Request

In this call, replace `c22ae540-b89a-4d24-bac0-4ef35e6591ea` with the ID of your access review definition returned in Step 4.

### Response

In this response, the scope includes a group identified by `59ab642a-2776-4e32-9b68-9ff7a47b7f6a` (the **Feel good marketing campaign** group created in Step 3) because it has a guest user.

            }
        }
    ]
}
```
In this response, the access review instance is currently `InProgress`. Because it's a quarterly review, a new review instance is created automatically every three months and the reviewers can apply new decisions.

## Step 6: Get decisions

Get the decisions taken for the instance of an access review.

### Request

In this call:
+ Replace `c22ae540-b89a-4d24-bac0-4ef35e6591ea` with the ID of your access review definition returned in Step 4.
+ Replace `6392b1a7-9c25-4844-83e5-34e23c88e16a` with the ID of your access review instance returned in Step 5.

In a quarterly review like this one, and as long as the access review is still active:
+ Every three months a new review instance will be created.
+ Reviewers will be required to apply new decisions for new instances.
