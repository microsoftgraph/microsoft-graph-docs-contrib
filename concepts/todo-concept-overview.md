## Why integrate with To Do?

### Ease of organizing and tracking tasks
Microsoft To Do helps you create a list for anything, from work assignments to home projects to groceries. You can keep track of deadlines by adding reminders, due dates, and notes. You can access your lists from anywhere with the Microsoft To Do apps for iOS, Android, Mac, Windows, and the web. 

### Integrate across Microsoft 365
To Do is the single destination for personal tasks in Microsoft 365. So it’s deeply integrated with Microsoft 365 hubs, Outlook, and Teams. Tasks created in those products sync with To Do so you can access and manage them across devices. To Do integration can help you reach millions of users who use To Do to gather tasks from Outlook and Teams into one integrated view.  

### Support task completion using linked resources
Microsoft To Do provides a new entity called _linked resource_, which you can use to create tasks that can link back to their original sources. You can use this to seamlessly integrate To Do in your workflow by creating tasks that link to your product or service.
