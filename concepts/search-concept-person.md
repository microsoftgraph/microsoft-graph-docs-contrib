# Use the Microsoft Search API to search people

Microsoft Graph applications can use the Microsoft Search API to retrieve the people who are most relevant to a user. Relevance is determined by the user’s communication and collaboration patterns and business relationships. People can be local contacts or from an organization’s directory or people from recent communications.

Along with generating this insight, search also provides fuzzy matching search support and the ability to retrieve the list of users relevant to another user in the signed-in user's organization.

## People APIs
You can use the following APIs to search for people inside an organization.

- /search
- /people

> [!NOTE]
> We recommended that users call the `/search` endpoint instead of the `/people` endpoint. Going forward, all future investments will only be available in the `/search` endpoint; the `/people` endpoint is in maintenance mode.

## Returned people properties
The people API returns the following set of properties.

| Property                 | Type    |

## Request details
Make the results of the people API more specific by giving additional details when you make a request. The following are a few ways to make the requests more specific.

### Example 1: Mailbox results only
```json
"Provenances": ["Mailbox"]
```

### Example 2: Results from both sources

```json
"Provenances": ["Mailbox", "Directory"]
```

## Source of results
People results come from two sources, mailbox or directory. By default, the results will come from both sources with conflicts being removed, which ensures that same values won't be returned.

> **Note**: In case of a conflict, directory sources are preferred.

Mailbox results consist of:

- People who sent you email
- People who you sent email to
- People you had meeting with
- People you had Teams chat with
- People in your manager's org chart
- Public contacts of the above people

Relevant aspects for the use case when a directory source searches in the global addressing list in Microsoft Entra ID:

- Not applicable for consumer users
- People who are not in the caller's global addressing list will not be returned
- People who are hidden by IBP (information barrier protocol) will not be returned
- People who are hidden in the address list will not be returned

## Get more results 
Specify the size to get more results. By default, 25 results or less will be returned based on the search query matches.

```json
"Size": 25   
```

## Specify the minimum index for paging
Set the minimum index for paging to specify the initial page of results. By default, the minimum index for paging is `0` and the first result is the most relevant.

```json
"From": 0   
```

## Select the fields to return 
The API returns a set of default properties, but you can customize a request to return a specific number of properties. The following example limits the response to the **DisplayName**, **EmailAddresses**, and **phones** properties.

```json
"Fields": ["DisplayName", "EmailAddresses", "phones"]  
```

## Use a filter to limit the response
Use the **Filter** object to limit the response to specific values. Possible filter values are: **PeopleType**, **PeopleSubType**.

The following examples show requests that use the **Filter** object to return people whose record contains the specified criteria.

### Example 1: Filter to person suggestions

The following example limits the response to only person suggestions. The response contains both private and organization contacts.

```json
"Filter": {
  "And": [
    {
      "Term": {
        "PeopleType": "Person"
      }
    }
  ]
},
```

### Example 2: Filter to person suggestions within the organization

The following example limits the reponse only to business users.

```json
"Filter": {
  "And": [
    {
      "Term": {
        "PeopleType": "Person"
      }
    },
    {
      "Term": {
        "PeopleSubtype": "OrganizationUser"
      }
    }
  ]
},
```

### Example 3: Filter to all users, distribution lists, or modern distribution list in the organization

The following example limits the response to different categories of **PeopleSubtype**.

```json
"Filter": {
  "Or": [
    {
      "Term": {
        "PeopleSubtype": "OrganizationUser"
      }
    },
    {
      "Term": {
        "PeopleSubtype": "PublicDistributionList"
      }
    },
    {
      "Term": {
        "PeopleSubtype": "UnifiedGroup"
      }
    }
  ]
},
```

### Example 4: Filter to organization users and meeting rooms

The following example limits the response to organization users and meeting rooms.

```json
"Filter": {
  "Or": [
    {
      "Term": {
        "PeopleSubtype": "OrganizationUser"
      }
    },
    {
      "Term": {
        "PeopleSubtype": "Rooms"
      }
    }
  ]
},
```

### Example 5: Filter to organization users and guests

The following example limits the response to organization users and guests.

``` json
"Filter": {
  "Or": [
    {
      "Term": {
        "PeopleSubtype": "OrganizationUser"
      }
    },
    {
      "Term": {
        "PeopleSubtype": "Guest"
      }
    }
  ]
},
```

### Example 6: Combine multiple filters

The following example combines multiple filters to limit the response to the specified criteria.

```json
"Filter": {
  "And": [
    {
      "Or": [
        {
          "Term": {
            "PeopleType": "Person"
          }
        },
        {
          "Term": {
            "PeopleType": "Other"
          }
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "Or": [
        {
          "Term": {
            "PeopleSubtype": "OrganizationUser"
          }
        },
        {
          "Term": {
            "PeopleSubtype": "Guest"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
},
```
