# Use the Microsoft Search API in Microsoft Graph to search people (preview)

Microsoft Graph applications can use the Microsoft Search API to retrieve the people who are most relevant to a user. Relevance is determined by the user’s communication and collaboration patterns and business relationships. People can be local contacts or from an organization’s directory, and people from recent communications. Along with generating this insight, search also provides fuzzy matching search support and the ability to retrieve the list of users relevant to another user in the signed in user's organization.

## Example: Search person by name

The following request gets the people most relevant to the signed-in user, based on communication and collaboration patterns and business relationships.

### Request

```HTTP
POST https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/search/query

        "queryString": "contoso"
      },
      "from": 0,
      "size": 25
    }
  ]
}
```
