# Permissions Management API operations quick reference for GCP authorization systems

The permissions management APIs enable you to discover permissions assigned to all identities across multiple clouds; request permissions; approve, reject, and cancel permissions requests. This article provides a quick reference guide for API operations on GCP authorization systems, supported through the permissions management APIs.

## Get all authorization systems

List all authorization systems onboarded to Permissions Management.

```http
GET https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/external/authorizationSystems
```

Filter authorization systems by name.
 
```http
GET https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/external/authorizationSystems?$filter=contains(authorizationSystemName, 'cloud')
```

## Get an authorization system

```http
GET https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/external/authorizationSystems/{id}
```

## List GCP authorization systems

List GCP authorization systems onboarded to Permissions Management by filtering by the **authorizationSystemType** property.

# [HTTP](#tab/http)
<!-- {
  "blockType": "request",
  "name": "list-authorizationsystems-gcp-via-filter"
}-->
```msgraph-interactive
GET https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/external/authorizationSystems?$filter=authorizationSystemType eq 'gcp'
