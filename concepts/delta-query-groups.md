#customer intent: As a developer, I want to track changes to groups, so that I can build apps that process the changes according to the business requirements.

# Get incremental changes for groups

The [delta query](./delta-query-overview.md) in Microsoft Graph lets you query for additions, deletions, or updates to [supported resources](delta-query-overview.md#supported-resources), through a series of [delta](/graph/api/group-delta?) requests. For groups, the delta query enables you to discover changes without fetching the entire set of groups to compare changes.

Clients that synchronize groups with a local profile store can use the delta query for both their initial full synchronization along with subsequent incremental synchronizations. Typically, a client does an initial full synchronization of all the groups in a tenant, and then gets incremental changes to groups periodically.

## Track changes to groups

Track user changes through one or more GET requests with the **delta** function. The GET request has the following characteristics:

- The **delta** function prepended to the URL path.
- A [state token](./delta-query-overview.md) (_deltatoken_ or _skiptoken_) from the previous GET **delta** function call.
- [Optional] Any supported query parameters

## Example

This article shows a series of example requests to track changes to groups:

1. An [initial request](#initial-request) and [response](#initial-response)
2. A [nextLink request](#nextlink-request) and [response](#nextlink-response)
3. A [final nextLink request](#final-nextlink-request) and [response](#final-nextlink-response)
4. A [deltaLink request](#deltalink-request) and [deltaLink response](#deltalink-response)

### Initial request

To track changes in the group resource, make a request and include the **delta** function as a URL segment.

> [!TIP]
> `/delta` is a shortcut for the fully qualified name `/microsoft.graph.delta`. Requests generated by Microsoft Graph SDKs use the fully qualified name.

Take note of the following items:

- The optional `$select` query parameter is included in the request to demonstrate how query parameters are automatically included in future requests. If you want to use query parameters to control how much data is returned, you must include them in the initial request.
  - Only properties included in `$select` are tracked for changes. If `$select` isn't specified, all properties of the object are tracked for changes.
- The optional `$select` query parameter is also used to show how group members can be retrieved together with group objects. This capability allows tracking of membership changes, such as when users are added or removed from groups.
- The initial request doesn't include a state token. State tokens are used in subsequent requests.
- Subsequent requests can't be modified.

### Initial response

If successful, this method returns `200 OK` response code and [group](/graph/api/resources/group) collection object in the response body. If the entire set of groups is too large to fit in one response, a `@odata.nextLink` containing a state token is included.

In this example, a `@odata.nextLink` URL is returned indicating there are more pages of data to be retrieved in the session. Notice the `$skiptoken` in the URL. The `$select` query parameter from the initial request is encoded into the `@odata.nextLink` URL.

The `members@delta` property is included in the **All Company** group and contains the two current members of the group. **sg-HR** doesn't contain that property because the group doesn't have any members.

### nextLink response

The response contains another `@odata.nextLink` with a new `skiptoken` value, which indicates that more changes that were tracked for groups are available. Use the `@odata.nextLink` URL in subsequent requests until a `@odata.deltaLink` URL (in an `@odata.deltaLink` parameter) is returned in the final response, even if the value is an empty array.

### Final nextLink response

When a `@odata.deltaLink` URL is returned, there's no more data about the existing state of group objects. For future requests, the application uses the `@odata.deltaLink` URL to learn about other changes to groups. Save the `deltatoken` and use it in the subsequent request URL to discover more changes to groups.

    }
  ]
}
```

### deltaLink request

Using the `@odata.deltaLink` from the [last response](#final-nextlink-response), you get changes (additions, deletions, or updates) to groups since the last request. Changes include:

- Newly created group objects.
- Deleted group objects.
- Group objects for which a tracked property changed (for example, an updated **displayName**).
- Group objects for which member objects were added or removed.

### deltaLink response

#### deltaLink response with an empty array

If there are no changes, a `@odata.deltaLink` is returned with no results - the **value** property is an empty array. Make sure to replace the previous link in the application with the new one for use in future calls.

<!-- {
  "blockType": "response",
  "truncated": true,
  "@odata.type": "microsoft.graph.group"
} -->
```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-type: application/json

{
  "@odata.context":"https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/$metadata#groups",
  "@odata.deltaLink":"https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/groups/delta?$deltatoken=sZwAFZibx-LQOdZIo1hHhmmDhHzCY0Hs6snoIHJCSIfCHdqKdWNZ2VX3kErpyna9GygROwBk-rqWWMFxJC3pw",
  "value": []
}
```

#### deltaLink response with changes

If there are changes, a collection of changed groups is included. The response also contains either a `@odata.nextLink` - in case there are multiple pages of changes to retrieve - or a `@odata.deltaLink`. Implement the same pattern of following the `@odata.nextLink` and persist the final `@odata.deltaLink` for future calls.

> [!NOTE]
> This request might have replication delays for groups that were recently created, updated, or deleted. Retry the `@odata.nextLink` or `@odata.deltaLink` after some time to retrieve the latest changes.

Some things to note about the example response:

- The objects are returned with the same set of properties originally specified via the `$select` query parameter.
- Both changed and unchanged properties are included - the **description** property has a new value, while the **displayName** property hasn't changed.
- `members@delta` contains the following changes to the group membership.
  - The user with ID `632f6bb2-3ec8-4c1f-9073-0027a8c6859` was removed from the group by removing their membership, as described by the `@removed` property. However, the delta function doesn't detect members that are removed from a group through deletion of the member object.
  - The second user with ID `37de1ae3-408f-4702-8636-20824abda004` was added to the group.

A group object can contain the `@removed` annotation in the following scenarios:

- When a group is deleted (Microsoft 365 groups), the item contains an annotation: `@removed` with value of `"reason": "changed"`.
- When the group is permanently deleted (a security group or [permanently deleting a Microsoft 365 group](/graph/api/directory-deleteditems-list)), the item contains  an annotation: `@removed` with value of `"reason": "deleted"`.
- When the group is created, or restored, there's no annotation.

          }
      ]
}
```

## Paging through members in a large group

The `members@delta` property is included in group objects by default, when the `$select` query parameter isn't specified, or when the `$select=members` parameter is explicitly specified. For groups with many members, it's possible that all members can't fit into a single response. Implement the following pattern to handle such cases.

> [!NOTE]
> This pattern applies to both the initial retrieval of group state and to subsequent calls to get delta changes.

Let's assume you're running the following delta query - either to capture the initial full state of groups, or later on to get delta changes:

1. Microsoft Graph might return a response that contains just one group object, with a large list of members in the `members@delta` property:

**First page**

<!-- {
  "blockType": "response",
  "truncated": true,
  "@odata.type": "microsoft.graph.group"
} -->
```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-type: application/json

{
  "@odata.context":"https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/$metadata#groups",
  "@odata.nextLink":"https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/groups/delta?$skiptoken=<...>",
  "value": [
    {
      "displayName":"LargeGroup",
      "description":"A group containing thousands of users",
      "id":"2e5807ce-58f3-4a94-9b37-ffff2e085957",
      "members@delta": [
          {
              "@odata.type": "#microsoft.graph.user",
              "id": "632f6bb2-3ec8-4c1f-9073-0027a8c6859",
              "@removed": {
                  "reason": "deleted"
              }
          },
          {
              "@odata.type": "#microsoft.graph.user",
              "id": "37de1ae3-408f-4702-8636-20824abda004"
          },
          <...more users here...>
      ]
    }
    <...no more groups included - this group filled out the entire response...>
  ]
}
```

2. When you follow the `@odata.nextLink`, you might receive a response containing the same group object. The same property values are returned but the `members@delta` property now contains a different list of users.

**Second page**

<!-- {
  "blockType": "response",
  "truncated": true,
  "@odata.type": "microsoft.graph.group"
} -->
```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-type: application/json
{
  "@odata.context":"https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/$metadata#groups",
  "@odata.nextLink":"https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/groups/delta?$skiptoken=<...>",
  "value": [
    {
      "displayName":"LargeGroup",
      "description":"A group containing thousands of users",
      "id":"2e5807ce-58f3-4a94-9b37-ffff2e085957",
      "members@delta": [
          {
              "@odata.type": "#microsoft.graph.user",
              "id": "c08a463b-7b8a-40a4-aa31-f9bf690b9551",
              "@removed": {
                  "reason": "deleted"
              }
          },
          {
              "@odata.type": "#microsoft.graph.user",
              "id": "23423fa6-821e-44b2-aae4-d039d33884c2"
          },
          <...more users here...>
      ]
    }
    <...no more groups included - this group filled out the entire response...>
  ]
}
```

3. Eventually, the entire member list is returned in this fashion, and other groups start showing up in the response.

We recommend the following best practices to correctly handle this pattern:
- Always follow `@odata.nextLink` and locally merge each group's state: as you receive responses related to the same group, use them to build the full membership list in your application.
- Don't assume a specific sequence of the responses. Assume that the same group could show up anywhere in the `@odata.nextLink` sequence and handle that in your merge logic.
