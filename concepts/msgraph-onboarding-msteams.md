# Microsoft Teams set up to work with your tenant users

In this section, you will set up Microsoft Teams on your system and create your first team.

Some teams could be already created during [School Data Sync](/graph/msgraph-onboarding-sds) process but here are the steps if you need to create more manually. You can follow the steps using a teacher or admin account from your [Microsoft EDU tenant](/graph/msgraph-onboarding-edutenant).

## Install Microsoft Teams

Open an InPrivate or Incognito browser window and browse to either to [teams.microsoft.com/download](https://teams.microsoft.com/download) if you want to install Microsoft teams in your computer or [teams.microsoft.com](https://teams.microsoft.com) to Sign In online.

Execute the downloaded installer and when prompted sign in with your O365 Global Admin account credentials.

After the installation finished, complete the welcome wizard.

## Create a team

1. On the menu on the left click **Teams** and then click the **Create team** button in the center (if you already have a team click the button at the top right corner of the list of teams called **Join or create a team** to make the Create team button show up in the center).

2. Select **Class** as the team type. Note that you will only see these choices if you are signed in into an educational tenant.

3. Enter a Name for your team.

4. Find some students by entering a letter in the search box and add them to your team by clicking the names and clicking **Add**. Repeat this step for each student and teacher in the class.
