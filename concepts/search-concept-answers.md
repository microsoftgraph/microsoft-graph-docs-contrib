# Set up administrative search answers for users in an organization

Microsoft Search lets administrators associate search terms with meanings or web pages that are specific to their organizations and include these associations as search answers. For example, users in an organization may run into an unfamiliar acronym that represents an internal project name, or a team name that is associated with a team web page. Administrators can set up [acronyms](/microsoftsearch/manage-acronyms), [bookmarks](/microsoftsearch/manage-bookmarks), or [QnAs](/microsoftsearch/manage-qas) in the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com/), under **Search & intelligence**. This enables users to use search to navigate and get familiarized with their work.

Administrators can also use the Microsoft Search API in Microsoft Graph to [programmatically manage administrative search answers](/graph/api/resources/search-api-answers-overview) in the organization. These answers are displayed in Microsoft Search results when triggered by an acronym or keyword defined in the available search answer resource types: [acronym](/graph/api/resources/search-acronym), [bookmark](/graph/api/resources/search-bookmark), and [qna](/graph/api/resources/search-qna) resources.

When triggered by a defined acronym or keyword, these search answers appear at the top of the search results page in your organization.

## Example 1: Create a new acronym
