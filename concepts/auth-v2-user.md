#customer intent: As a developer, I want to understand how my app can run with it's own identity, without a signed in user, and call Microsoft Graph to access resources in a tenant.

# Get access on behalf of a user

To call Microsoft Graph, an app must obtain an access token from the Microsoft identity platform. This access token includes information about whether the app is authorized to access Microsoft Graph on behalf of a signed-in user or with its own identity. This article provides guidance on how an app can [access Microsoft Graph on behalf of a user](./auth/auth-concepts.md#access-scenarios), also called *delegated access*.

This article details the raw HTTP requests involved for an app to get access on behalf of a user using a popular flow called the [OAuth 2.0 authorization code grant flow](/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-auth-code-flow#). Alternatively, you can avoid writing raw HTTP requests and use a Microsoft-built or supported authentication library that handles many of these details for you and helps you to get access tokens and call Microsoft Graph. For more information, see [Use the Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL)](#use-the-microsoft-authentication-library-msal).

In this article, you complete the following steps in using the OAuth 2.0 authorization code grant flow:

1. Request authorization.
2. Request an access token.
3. Use the access token to call Microsoft Graph.
4. [Optional] Use the refresh token to renew an expired access token.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding with the steps in this article:

1. Understand the authentication and authorization concepts in the Microsoft identity platform. For more information, see [Authentication and authorization basics](auth/auth-concepts.md).
2. Register the app with Microsoft Entra ID. For more information, see [Register an application with the Microsoft identity platform](auth-register-app-v2.md). Save the following values from the app registration:
    - The application ID (referred to as Object ID on the Microsoft Entra admin center).
    - A client secret (application password), a certificate, or a federated identity credential. This property isn't needed for public clients like native, mobile, and single page applications.
    - A redirect URI for the app to receive token responses from Microsoft Entra ID.

## Step 1: Request authorization

The first step in the authorization code flow is for the user to authorize the app to act on their behalf.

In the flow, the app redirects the user to the Microsoft identity platform `/authorize` endpoint. Through this endpoint, Microsoft Entra ID signs the user in and requests their consent for the permissions that the app requests. After consent is obtained, Microsoft Entra ID returns an authorization **code** to the app. The app can then redeem this code at the Microsoft identity platform `/token` endpoint for an access token.

### Authorization request

The following example shows a request to the `/authorize` endpoint.

In the request URL, you call the `/authorize` endpoint and specify the required and recommended properties as query parameters.

In the following example, the app requests the _User.Read_ and _Mail.Read_ Microsoft Graph permissions, which allow the app to read the profile and mail of the signed-in user respectively. The _offline\_access_ permission is a standard OIDC scope that's requested so that the app can get a refresh token. The app can use the refresh token to get a new access token when the current one expires.

| response_type | Required    | Must include `code` for the OAuth 2.0 authorization code flow.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| redirect_uri  | Recommended | The redirect URI of the app, where authentication responses are sent to and received by the app. It must exactly match one of the redirect URIs you registered in the app registration portal, except it must be URL encoded. For native and mobile apps, you should use the default value of `https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/nativeclient`.                                                                                                                                    |
| scope         | Required    | A space-separated list of the Microsoft Graph permissions that you want the user to consent to. These permissions can include resource permissions, such as _User.Read_ and _Mail.Read_, and OIDC scopes, such as `offline_access`, which indicates that the app needs a refresh token for long-lived access to resources.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| response_mode | Recommended | Specifies the method that should be used to send the resulting token back to the app. Can be `query` or `form_post`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| state         | Recommended | A value included in the request that's also returned in the token response. It can be a string of any content that you wish. A randomly generated unique value is typically used for [preventing cross-site request forgery attacks](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-10.12). This property is also used to encode information about the user's state in the app before the authentication request occurred, such as the page or view they were on.                                  |

### User consent experience

After the app sends the authorization request, the user is asked to enter their credentials to authenticate with Microsoft. The Microsoft identity platform v2.0 endpoint ensures that the user has consented to the permissions indicated in the `scope` query parameter. If there's any permission that the user or administrator hasn't consented to, they're asked to consent to the required permissions. For more information about the Microsoft Entra consent experience, see [Application consent experience](/azure/active-directory/develop/application-consent-experience) and [Introduction to permissions and consent](/azure/active-directory/develop/permissions-consent-overview#consent).

The following screenshot is an example of the consent dialog box presented for a Microsoft account user.

### Authorization response

If the user consents to the permissions the app requested, the response contains the authorization code in the `code` parameter. Here's an example of a successful response to the previous request. Because the `response_mode` parameter in the request was set to `query`, the response is returned in the query string of the redirect URL.

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK

https://localhost/myapp/?code=M0ab92efe-b6fd-df08-87dc-2c6500a7f84d&state=12345&session_state=fe1540c3-a69a-469a-9fa3-8a2470936421#
```

##### Query parameters

| Parameter     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| code          | The authorization code that the app requested. The app uses the authorization code to request an access token for the target resource. Authorization codes are short lived, typically they expire after about 10 minutes.                                                                                              |
| state         | If a state parameter is included in the request, the same value should appear in the response. The app should verify that the state values in the request and response are identical. This check helps to detect [Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-10.12) against the client. |
| session_state | A unique value that identifies the current user session. This value is a GUID, but should be treated as an opaque value that is passed without examination.                                                                                                                                                                |

## Step 2: Request an access token

The app uses the authorization `code` received in the previous step to request an access token by sending a `POST` request to the `/token` endpoint.

| ext_expires_in    | Indicates an extended lifetime for the access token (in seconds) and used to support resiliency when the token issuance service isn't responding.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| access_token  | The requested access token. The app can use this token to call Microsoft Graph.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| refresh_token | An OAuth 2.0 refresh token. The app can use this token to acquire additional access tokens after the current access token expires. Refresh tokens are long-lived, and can be used to retain access to resources for extended periods of time. A refresh token will only be returned if `offline_access` was included as a `scope` parameter. For details, see the [v2.0 token reference](/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-v2-tokens). |

## Step 3: Use the access token to call Microsoft Graph

After you have an access token, the app uses it to call Microsoft Graph by attaching the access token as a **Bearer** token to the **Authorization** header in an HTTP request. The following request gets the profile of the signed-in user.

### Request

# [HTTP](#tab/http)

```http
GET https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me  HTTP/1.1
Authorization: Bearer eyJ0eXAiO ... 0X2tnSQLEANnSPHY0gKcgw
Host: graph.microsoft.com
```

# [cURL](#tab/curl)

```bash
curl --location --request GET 'https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer eyJ0eXAiO ... 0X2tnSQLEANnSPHY0gKcgw' \
--data ''
```

---

### Response

A successful response looks similar to the following (some response headers have been removed).

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK

    "userPrincipalName": "admin@contoso.com",
    "id": "10a08e2e-3ea2-4ce0-80cb-d5fdd4b05ea6"
}
```

## Step 4: Use the refresh token to renew an expired access token

Access tokens are short lived, and the app must refresh them after they expire to continue accessing resources. The app does so by submitting another `POST` request to the `/token` endpoint, this time:

- Providing the `refresh_token` instead of the **code** in the request body
- Specifying `refresh_token` as the **grant_type**, instead of `authorization_code`.

## Use the Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL)

In this article, you walked through the low-level protocol details that are required only when manually crafting and issuing raw HTTP requests to execute the authorization code flow. In production apps, use a [Microsoft-built or supported authentication library](/azure/active-directory/develop/msal-overview), such as the Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL), to get security tokens and call protected web APIs such as Microsoft Graph. Also, explore how to [choose a Microsoft Graph authentication provider based on scenario](./sdks/choose-authentication-providers.md).

MSAL and other supported authentication libraries simplify the process for you by handling details such as validation, cookie handling, token caching, and secure connections, allowing you to focus on the functionality of your application.

Microsoft has built and maintains a wide selection of code samples that demonstrate usage of supported authentication libraries with the Microsoft identity platform. To access these code samples, see the [Microsoft identity platform code samples](/entra/identity-platform/sample-v2-code?tabs=apptype#service--daemon).
