# Get incremental changes to events in a calendar view

By using delta query, you can get new, updated, or deleted events in a specified calendar or within a defined collection of events (as a calendar view) in the calendar. This article describes the latter: getting such incremental changes to events in a calendar view.

> [!NOTE]
> The capability for the former&mdash;getting incremental changes to events in a calendar not bound to a fixed start and end date range&mdash;is currently available only in the beta version. For more information, see [delta](/graph/api/event-delta) function.

A calendar view is a collection of events in a date/time range (../me/calendarView) from the default calendar or some other specified calendar of a user or from a group calendar. The returned events may include single instances or occurrences and exceptions of a recurring series. The delta data enables you to maintain and synchronize a local store of a user's events without having to fetch the entire set of the user's events from the server every time.

Delta query supports both full synchronization that retrieves all the events in the specified calendar view, and incremental synchronization that retrieves those events that have changed in the calendar view since the last synchronization. Typically, you would do an initial full synchronization, and subsequently get incremental changes to that calendar view periodically.

## Track event changes in a calendar view

Delta query for events in a calendar view is specific to a calendar and date/time range that you specify. To track the changes in multiple calendars, you need to track each calendar individually.

Tracking event changes in a calendar view typically is a round of one or more GET requests with the [delta](/graph/api/event-delta) function. The initial GET request is very much like the way you [list a calendarView](/graph/api/calendar-list-calendarview) except that you include the **delta** function. The following is the initial GET delta request of a calendar view in the signed-in user's default calendar:

```
GET /me/calendarView/delta?startDateTime={start_datetime}&endDateTime={end_datetime}
```

A GET request with the **delta** function returns either:

- A `@odata.nextLink` (that contains a URL with a **delta** function call and a `$skipToken`), or 
- A `@odata.deltaLink` (that contains a URL with a **delta** function call and `$deltaToken`).

These tokens are [state tokens](delta-query-overview.md#state-tokens) which encode the 
_startDateTime_ and _endDateTime_ parameters, and any other query parameter 
in your initial delta query GET request. You do not need to include these parameters in subsequent requests as they are encoded in the tokens.

State tokens are completely opaque to the client. 
To proceed with a round of change tracking, simply copy and apply the `@odata.nextLink` or 
`@odata.deltaLink` URL returned from the last GET 
request to the next **delta** function call for that same calendar view. A `@odata.deltaLink` returned in a response 
signifies that the current round of change tracking is complete. You can save and use the `@odata.deltaLink` URL
when you begin the next round.

See the [example](#example-synchronize-events-in-a-calendar-view) to learn how to use these `@odata.nextLink` and `@odata.deltaLink` URLs.

### Use query parameters in a delta query for calendar view

- Include the _startDateTime_ and _endDateTime_ parameters to define a date/time range for your calendar view.
- `$select` is not supported.


### Optional request header

Each delta query GET request returns a collection of one or more events in the response. You can optionally specify 
the request header, `Prefer: odata.maxpagesize={x}`, to set the maximum number of events in a response.


## Example: synchronize events in a calendar view

The following example shows a series of 3 requests to synchronize the user's default calendar in a specific time range. There are 5 events in that calendar view.

- [Step 1: sample initial request](#step-1-sample-initial-request) and [response](#sample-initial-response)
- [Step 2: sample second request](#step-2-sample-second-request) and [response](#sample-second-response)
- [Step 3: sample third request](#step-3-sample-third-request) and [final response](#sample-third-and-final-response)

For brevity, the sample responses show only a subset of the properties for an event. In an actual call, most event properties
are returned. 

See what you'll do in the [next round](#the-next-round-sample-first-response).


### Step 1: sample initial request

In this example, the specified calendar view in the signed-in user's default calendar is being synchronized for the first time, so the initial sync request does not include any state token. 
This round will return all the events in that calendar view.

The first request specifies the following:

- Date/time values for the _startDateTime_ and _endDateTime_ parameters.
- The [optional request header](#optional-request-header), _odata.maxpagesize_, returning 2 events at a time.

### Sample initial response

The response includes two events and a `@odata.nextLink` response header with a `skipToken`. 
The `@odata.nextLink` URL indicates there are more events in the calendar view to get.

the same _startDateTime_ and _endDateTime_ parameters as in the initial request, as the `skipToken` in the `@odata.nextLink` URL encodes and includes them.

### Sample second response 

The second response returns the next 2 events in the calendar view and another `@odata.nextLink`, indicating there are 
more events to get from the calendar view.

### Step 3: sample third request

The third request continues to use the latest `@odata.nextLink` returned from the last sync request.

### Sample third and final response

The third response returns the only remaining event in the calendar view, and a `@odata.deltaLink` URL which indicates 
synchronization is complete for this calendar view. Save and use the `@odata.deltaLink` URL to 
[synchronize that calendar view in the next round](#the-next-round-sample-first-request).

```


### The next round: sample first request

Using the `@odata.deltaLink` from the [last request](#step-3-sample-third-request) in the last round, 
you will be able to get only those events that have changed (by being added, deleted, or updated) in that calendar view since then.
Your first request in the next round will look like the following, assuming you prefer to keep the same maximum page size in the response:
