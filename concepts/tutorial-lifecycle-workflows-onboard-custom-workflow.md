# Automate employee onboarding tasks before their first day of work using Lifecycle Workflows APIs

This tutorial explains how to automate prehire tasks with Lifecycle Workflows APIs.

:::image type="content" source="images/tutorial-lifecycle-workflows/arch-2.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Lifecycle Workflows scenario." lightbox="images/tutorial-lifecycle-workflows/arch-2.png":::

In this tutorial, you learn how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Configure a lifecycle workflow to check for new employees in a specific department, two days before their hire date.
> * Configure a task to generate a temporary access pass (TAP) for the new employee and send it to the new employee's manager.
> * Monitor the status of the workflow and its associated tasks.

## Prerequisites

To complete this tutorial, you need these resources and privileges:

+ This feature requires Microsoft Entra ID Governance licenses. See [Microsoft Entra ID Governance licensing fundamentals](/entra/id-governance/licensing-fundamentals) to find the right license for your requirements.
+ Sign in to an API client like [Graph Explorer](https://aka.ms/ge) to call Microsoft Graph with an account that has at least the *Lifecycle Administrator* Microsoft Entra role.
+ Grant yourself the *LifecycleWorkflows.ReadWrite.All* Microsoft Graph delegated permission.
+ Create two user accounts for this tutorial: one for the new hire and another for their manager. Configure the following settings as applicable.

    | User property | Description |Set on|
    |:--- |:---|:-----|
    |mail|Used to notify manager of the new employee's temporary access pass (TAP). Both the manager and employee should have active mailboxes to receive emails.|Employee, Manager|
    |manager|This attribute that is used by the lifecycle workflow.|Employee|
    |employeeHireDate|Used to trigger the workflow. Set to today's date.|Employee|
    |department|Used to provide the scope for the workflow. Set to `Sales`.|Employee, Manager|

+ Enable the [Temporary Access Pass (TAP) policy](/entra/identity/authentication/howto-authentication-temporary-access-pass#enable-the-temporary-access-pass-policy) in your tenant and ensure the new user is enabled to use the authentication method.

## Create a "joiner" workflow

### Request

This request creates a prehire workflow with these settings:

+ It can be run on-demand but not on schedule.
+ The workflow runs two days before the employee's hire date, and if they are in the "Sales" department.
+ Only one built-in task runs in this workflow: to generate the TAP and send it to the new hire's manager. This task is identified in Lifecycle Workflows by the **taskDefinitionId** `1b555e50-7f65-41d5-b514-5894a026d10d`.

## Run the workflow

Because the workflow isn't scheduled, you must run it manually. In the following request, the user that's the target of the workflow is identified by ID `8930f0c7-cdd7-4885-9260-3b4a8111de5c`. The request returns a `204 No Content` response.

## Check tasks and workflow status

You can monitor the status of workflows and their associated tasks at three levels.
- Monitor tasks at the user level.
- Monitor the high-level summary of user-level results for a workflow within a specified period.
- Retrieve the detailed log of all tasks executed for a specific user in the workflow.

### Option 1: Monitor tasks for a workflow at the user level

## [Optional] Schedule the workflow to run automatically

After running your workflow on-demand and confirming it works, enable the workflow to run automatically on a tenant-defined schedule. Run the following request.

The request returns a `204 No Content` response. When a workflow is scheduled, the Lifecycle Workflows engine checks every three hours for user objects that match the execution condition and executes the configured tasks. You can customize this recurrence from one to 24 hours.
