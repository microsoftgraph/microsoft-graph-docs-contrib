# Display a chart image in Excel

When you perform a [GET operation to retrieve a chart image](/graph/api/chart-image), the Excel API in Microsoft Graph returns the image as a base-64 string. You can display the base-64 string inside an HTML image tag:

```html
 <img src="data:image/png;base64,{base-64 chart image string}/>
```

For default behavior, use `Image(width=0,height=0,fittingMode='fit')`.

Following is an example of a chart image returned with the default parameters.

If you want to customize the display of the image, specify a height, width, and a fitting mode. Here is what the same chart image looks like if you retrieve it with these parameters: `Image(width=500,height=500,fittingMode='Fill')`.
