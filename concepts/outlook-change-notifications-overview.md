# Change notifications for Outlook resources in Microsoft Graph

The Microsoft Graph API lets you subscribe to changes to a resource&mdash;including creation, update, or deletion of the resource&mdash;and receive notifications via webhooks. A [subscription](/graph/api/resources/change-notifications-api-overview) specifies the desired types of changes to monitor for a specific resource, and includes a URL for an endpoint to receive notifications of those changes.

Setting up a subscription reduces the overhead of otherwise having to query and compare resources to deduce any changes. You can optionally specify in the subscription request to encrypt and include as part of a notification the resource data that has changed, saving a separate subsequent API call to get the resource payload.

There is a maximum limit of 1000 active subscriptions for Outlook resources per mailbox for all applications. You can subscribe to changes in contacts, events, or messages in the mailbox.

## Subscribe to changes in contacts, calendar, or mail

To subscribe to change notifications of Outlook resources, first create a [subscription](/graph/api/resources/subscription).

The following Outlook resources support subscriptions with or without resource data in the [change notification](/graph/api/resources/changenotification) payload.

- [contact](/graph/api/resources/contact)
- [event](/graph/api/resources/event)
- [message](/graph/api/resources/message)

## Create a subscription

To create a subscription, specify the Outlook resource and the type of changes (creation, update, or deletion) for which you want to receive notifications. See an [example](#example-1-create-a-subscription-to-get-change-notifications-without-resource-data-when-the-user-receives-a-new-message).

### Request permissions

[!INCLUDE [outlook-subscription-notes](../includes/outlook-subscription-notes.md)]

Depending on the resource, use the least privileged permission specified in the following table to call this API.

| Resource| Supported Resource Paths| Delegated (work or school account)| Delegated (personal Microsoft account)| Application|
|:--------|:------------------------|:----------------------------------|:--------------------------------------|:-----------|
|[contact](/graph/api/resources/contact) | Changes to all personal contacts in a user's mailbox: <br>`/me/contacts`<br>`/users/{id}/contacts`<br>Changes to contacts in a user's contactFolder:<br>`/users/{id}/contactFolders/{id}/contacts` | Contacts.Read | Contacts.Read | Contacts.Read |
|[event](/graph/api/resources/event)     | Changes to all events in a user's mailbox: <br>`/me/events`<br>`/users/{id}/events` | Calendars.Read | Calendars.Read | Calendars.Read |
|[message](/graph/api/resources/message) | Changes to all messages in a user's mailbox: <br>`/me/messages`<br>`/users/{id}/messages`<br>Changes to messages in a user's mailFolder:<br>`/users/{id}/mailFolders/{id}/messages` | Mail.ReadBasic, Mail.Read | Mail.ReadBasic, Mail.Read | Mail.ReadBasic, Mail.Read |

### Include resource data in notification payload

To have resource data included in a change notification, you **must** specify the following properties, in addition to those you normally include when creating a subscription:

- **includeResourceData**: Set this property to `true` to explicitly request resource data.
- **resource**: This property specifies the resource URL. Make sure to use the `$select` query parameter to explicitly specify the Outlook resource properties to include in the notification payload.

  > [!NOTE]
  > Do not include in the URL `$top`, `$skip`, `$orderby`, `$select=Body,UniqueBody`, and `$expand` other than **singleValueExtendedProperties** or **multiValueExtendedProperties**.

- **encryptionCertificate**: This property contains only the public key that Microsoft Graph uses to encrypt resource data. Keep the corresponding private key to [decrypt the content](change-notifications-with-resource-data.md#decrypting-resource-data-from-change-notifications).
- **encryptionCertificateId**: This property is your own identifier for the certificate. Use this ID to match in each change notification which certificate to use for decryption.

See an [example](#example-2-create-a-subscription-to-get-change-notifications-with-resource-data-when-the-user-receives-a-new-message) for subscribing to change notifications with resource data for the **message** resource.


### Refine the conditions for a notification
You can further refine the conditions for a notification by using the `$filter` query parameter. See an [example](#example-3-create-a-subscription-to-get-change-notifications-with-resource-data-for-a-message-based-on-a-condition).

One common application of `$filter` is to get notified upon a change in a specific resource property. For example, you can use `$filter` to subscribe to unread messages in a folder (the **isRead** property is `false`), and include all the change types:
- A message added to or marked unread in the folder would trigger a `Created` notification.
- Reading a message or marking it as read in the folder would trigger a `Deleted` notification.
- A change to any property, other than **isRead**, of a **message** resource in the folder would trigger an `Updated` notification.

If you don't use a `$filter` when creating the subscription:
- Adding a message to the folder would result in a `Created` notification.
- Reading a message in the folder, marking the message as read, or changing any other property of a message in that folder would result in an `Updated` notification.
- Deleting the message would result in a `Delete` notification.

### Subscribe to lifecycle notifications
The Outlook **contact**, **event**, and **message** resources also support subscribing to lifecycle notifications. Lifecycle notifications are needed in case your app gets their subscriptions removed or misses some change notifications. Apps should implement logic to detect and recover from the loss, and resume a continuous change notification flow. To learn more, see [subscribing to lifecycle notifications](change-notifications-lifecycle-events.md).

### Keep track of subscription lifetime
Make sure to [extend](/graph/api/subscription-update) a subscription before it expires. The maximum lifetime for a subscription without Outlook resource data can be found in the [subscription lifetime table](change-notifications-overview.md#subscription-lifetime).

If you lose the permission granted earlier for a subscription and the subscription expires meanwhile, request permission again to [create](/graph/api/subscription-post-subscriptions) a new subscription.

## Receive notification payloads

Depending on your subscription, notifications may include resource data. Subscriptions with resource data allow you to get the
resource payload along with the notification, avoiding the overhead for a separate API call to get the changed resource data.

### Receive notifications with resource data

The following is an example of the payload of a notification with resource data of a **message** resource. The  **resource** and **resourceData** properties correspond to the **message** instance that triggered the notification. Use the **encryptedContent** property to decrypt the resource data.

```json
{
    "value": [
      {
        "subscriptionId": "dfd11b2f-8222-4189-9545-4205c95d6235",
        "subscriptionExpirationDateTime": "2021-12-31T16:16:44.9907405+05:30",
        "changeType": "created",
        "resource": "Users('722effaf-0433-4272-9ac4-d5ec11c3cd77')/messages('AAMkAGUwNjQ4ZjIxLTQ3Y2Y8AAA=')",
        "clientState": "<<--SpecifiedClientState-->>",
        "tenantId": "<<--TenantForWhichNotificationWasSent-->>",
        "encryptedContent": {
          "data": "<<--EncryptedContent-->>",
          "dataKey": "<<--EnryptedDataKeyUsedForEncryptingContent-->>",
          "dataSignature": "Qw/9ubWeUYJPWWXvNiGgct2FkNG2MXTRm/BLUpJM66k=",
          "encryptionCertificateId": "<<--IdOfTheCertificateUsedForEncryptingDataKey-->>",
          "encryptionCertificateThumbprint": "<<--ThumbprintOfTheCertificateUsedForEncryptingDataKey-->>"
        },
        "resourceData": {
          "@odata.type": "#microsoft.graph.message",
          "@odata.id": "Users('722effaf-0433-4272-9ac4-d5ec11c3cd77')/messages('AAMkAGUwNjQ4ZjIxLTQ3Y2Y8AAA=')",
          "@odata.etag": "W/\"CQAAABYAAACQ2fKdhq8oSKEDSVrdi3lRAAGDUR8n\"",
          "id": "AAMkAGUwNjQ4ZjIxLTQ3Y2Y8AAA="
        }
      }
    ]
    "validationTokens": ["<<--ValidationTokens-->>"]
}
```

For details about how to validate tokens and decrypt the payload, see [Set up change notifications that include resource data](change-notifications-with-resource-data.md).

The following is an example of a decrypted notification payload. The decrypted payload conforms to the Outlook [message](/graph/api/resources/message) schema. The payload is similar to that returned by a [GET message](/graph/api/message-get) operation. However, the notification payload contains only those properties specified with a `$select` parameter in the **resource** property of the subscription. Notification payloads for other Outlook resources like [contact](/graph/api/resources/contact) and [event](/graph/api/resources/event) follow their respective schemas.

```json
{
    "receivedDateTime@odata.type":"#DateTimeOffset",
    "receivedDateTime":"2021-12-30T10:53:35Z",
    "subject":"TEST MESSAGE FOR RICH NOTIFICATIONS",
    "bodyPreview":"Hello,\r\n\r\nWhat\u2019s up?\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nMegan",
    "importance@odata.type":"#microsoft.graph.importance",
    "importance":"normal",
    "from": {
        "@odata.type":"#microsoft.graph.recipient",
        "emailAddress": {
            "@odata.type":"#microsoft.graph.emailAddress",
            "name":"Megan Brown",
            "address":"Megan.Brown@microsoft.com"
        }
    }
}
```

### Receive notifications without resource data

Notifications without resource data give you enough information to make GET calls to get the resource. Subscriptions for notifications without resource data don't require an encryption certificate, because the actual resource data is not sent over.

The next example shows the payload of a notification that corresponds to an Outlook **message** resource. It includes the **resource** and **resourceData** properties, which represent the resource that triggered the notification. Use the **resource** and **@odata.id** properties to make calls to Microsoft Graph to get the payload of the resource.

> [!NOTE]
> GET calls always return the current state of the resource. If the resource is changed between the time the notification is sent and the time the resource is retrieved, the operation returns the state of the resource on retrieval.


```json
"value": [
 {
   "subscriptionId": "c6126aa3-0ed8-412f-a988-71e6cee627c4",
   "subscriptionExpirationDateTime": "2022-01-02T03:12:18.2257768+05:30",
   "changeType": "created",
   "resource": "Users/622eaaff-0683-4862-9de4-f2ec83c2bd98/Messages/AAMkAGUwNjQ4ZjIxAAA=",
   "resourceData": {
     "@odata.type": "#Microsoft.Graph.Message",
     "@odata.id": "Users/622eaaff-0683-4862-9de4-f2ec83c2bd98/Messages/AAMkAGUwNjQ4ZjIAAA=",
     "@odata.etag": "W/\"CQAAABYAAACQ2fKdhq8oSKEDSVrdi3lRAAGDUUXn\"",
     "id": "AAMkAGUwNjQ4ZjIxAAA="
   },
   "clientState": "<<--SpecifiedClientState-->>",
   "tenantId": "<<--TenantForWhichNotificationWasSent-->>"
 }
]
```
