# Error codes for the OneNote API in Microsoft Graph

This article describes error codes that the OneNote API in Microsoft Graph returns when a request that is sent through the API fails.

## Error response example

When your request generates an error, the OneNote API stops performing the request and returns an error response as a JSON object. An error response contains the associated error code, a message, and a link to the appropriate section of this article. The following example shows how an error response looks.

```json
{
   "error":{
      "code":"10002",
      "message":"The service is currently unavailable. Please try again later.",
      "innerError": {
        "requestId": "request-id",
        "date": "date-time"
      }
   }
}
```

For more information about Microsoft Graph errors, see [Microsoft Graph error responses and resource types](errors.md).

## Codes from 10001 to 19999

The service is having problems or is sending information to the application.

### 10001
An unexpected error occurred and the request failed.

### 10002
The service is not currently available.

### 10003
The current user's account exceeded the maximum number of active requests. Your app needs to repeat the request.

### 10004
The service can't create a page in the requested section because that section is protected by a password.

### 10005
The request contains more than the maximum number of image tags in which the **data-render-src** attribute contains a PDF. See [Add images and files](onenote-images-files.md).

### 10006
The OneNote API was unable to create a page in the specified section because that section is corrupt.

### 10007
The server is too busy to handle the incoming request at this moment. Try again later.

### 10008
One or more of the document libraries on the user or group's OneDrive contains more than 5000 OneNote items (notebooks, sections, section groups), and cannot be queried using the API. Make sure that none of the user or group's document libraries contains more than 5000 OneNote items. See the [OneNote Dev blog](/archive/blogs/onenotedev/onenote-api-calls-fail-with-a-large-number-of-items-in-a-sharepoint-document-library) for mitigation steps.

### 10012
Unable to create or update the entity because the library that contains the notebook requires items to be checked out before they can be edited. For more information, see [Set up a library to require check-out of files](https://support.office.com/article/Configure-a-site-library-to-require-check-out-of-files-f63fcbdc-1db6-4eb7-a3eb-dd815500c9e7).

Either remove the check-out requirement from the library, or move the notebook.

### 10013
One or more of the document libraries on the user or group's OneDrive contains more than 20,000 items and cannot be indexed for querying using the API. Make sure that none of the user or group's document libraries contains more than 20,000 items. See the [OneNote Dev blog](/archive/blogs/onenotedev/onenote-api-calls-fail-with-a-large-number-of-items-in-a-sharepoint-document-library) for mitigation steps.

### 10014
Azure Key Vault is too busy to handle the incoming request at this moment. Try again later.

### 10015
SharePoint is currently unavailable. Try again later.

### 10016
Document library on the user or group's OneDrive exceeded unique security scopes threshold limit. The maximum number of unique security scopes set for a library cannot exceed 50,000.

### 10017
Bad Request.

### 19999
The request failed because an undetermined error occurred.
