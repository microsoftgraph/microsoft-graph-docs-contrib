# Get incremental changes for users

The [delta query](./delta-query-overview.md) in Microsoft Graph lets you query for additions, deletions, or updates to [supported resources](delta-query-overview.md#supported-resources), through a series of [delta](/graph/api/user-delta) requests. For users, the delta query enables you to discover changes without fetching the entire set of users to compare changes.

Clients that synchronize users with a local profile store can use the delta query for both their initial full synchronization along with subsequent incremental synchronizations. Typically, a client does an initial full synchronization of all the users in a tenant, and then gets incremental changes to users periodically.

## Track changes to users

Track user changes through one or more GET requests with the **delta** function. The GET request has the following characteristics:

- The **delta** function prepended to the URL path. 
- A [state token](./delta-query-overview.md) (_deltatoken_ or _skipToken_) from the previous GET **delta** function call.
- [Optional] Any supported query parameters

## Example

This article shows a series of example requests to track changes to users:

1. An [initial request](#initial-request) and [response](#initial-response)
2. A [nextLink request](#nextlink-request) and [response](#nextlink-response)
3. A [final nextLink request](#final-nextlink-request) and [response](#final-nextlink-response)
4. A [deltaLink request](#deltalink-request) and [deltaLink response](#deltalink-response)

### Initial request

To track changes in the user resource, make a request and include the **delta** function as a URL segment.

> [!TIP]
> `/delta` is a shortcut for the fully qualified name `/microsoft.graph.delta`. Requests generated by Microsoft Graph SDKs use the fully qualified name.

Take note of the following items:

- The optional `$select` query parameter is included in the request to demonstrate how query parameters are automatically included in future requests. If you want to use query parameters to control how much data is returned, you must include them in the initial request.
  - Only properties included in `$select` are tracked for changes. If `$select` isn't specified, all properties of the object are tracked for changes.
- The initial request doesn't include a state token. State tokens are used in subsequent requests.
- Subsequent requests can't be modified.
- [Limitations of query parameters in delta functions](delta-query-overview.md#optional-query-parameters).

### Initial response

If successful, this method returns `200 OK` response code and [user](/graph/api/resources/user) collection object in the response body. If the entire set of users is too large, the response includes a `@odata.nextLink` state token in an `@odata.nextLink` parameter.

In this example, a `@odata.nextLink` URL is returned indicating there are more pages of data to be retrieved in the session. Notice the `$skiptoken` in the URL. The `$select` query parameter from the initial request is encoded into the `@odata.nextLink` URL.

The response also contains an `@removed` annotation for a user with ID `86462606-fde0-4fc4-9e0c-a20eb73e54c6`. The `@removed` annotation is added in the following scenarios:

- When the user is deleted, the item contains an annotation: `@removed` with value of `"reason": "changed"`.
- When the user is [permanently deleted](/graph/api/directory-deleteditems-delete), the item contains an annotation: `@removed` with value of `"reason": "deleted"`.
- When the user is created, or restored from the deleted items container, there's no annotation.

### nextLink response

The response contains another `@odata.nextLink` with a new `skipToken` value, which indicates that more changes that were tracked for users are available. Use the `@odata.nextLink` URL in more requests until a `@odata.deltaLink` URL (in an `@odata.deltaLink` parameter) is returned in the final response, even if the value is an empty array.

### Final nextLink response

This response includes an `@odata.deltaLink` URL, which indicates there's no more data about the existing state of the user objects. For future requests, the application uses the `@odata.deltaLink` URL to learn about other changes to users. Save the `deltatoken` and use it in the subsequent request URL to discover more changes to users.

### deltaLink request

Using the `deltatoken` from the [last response](#final-nextlink-response), you get changes (additions, deletions, or updates) to users since the last request.

## deltaLink response

If there are no changes, a `@odata.deltaLink` is returned with no results - the **value** property is an empty array.

<!-- {
  "blockType": "response",
  "truncated": true,
  "@odata.type": "microsoft.graph.user"
} -->

  "value": []
}
```

If there are changes, a collection of changed user objects is included. The response also contains either a `@odata.nextLink` - in case there are multiple pages of changes to retrieve - or a `@odata.deltaLink`. Implement the same pattern of following the `@odata.nextLink` and persist the final `@odata.deltaLink` for future calls.

> [!NOTE]
> This request might have replication delays for users that were recently created, updated, or deleted. Retry the `@odata.nextLink` or `@odata.deltaLink` after some time to retrieve the latest changes.
