# Microsoft Graph permissions reference

For an app to access data in Microsoft Graph, the user or administrator must grant it the permissions it needs. This article lists the delegated and application permissions exposed by Microsoft Graph. For guidance about how to use the permissions, see the [Overview of Microsoft Graph permissions](permissions-overview.md).

To read information about all Microsoft Graph permissions programmatically, sign in to an API client such as Graph Explorer using an account that has at least the *Application.Read.All* permission and run the following request.

```msgraph-interactive
GET https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/servicePrincipals(appId='00000003-0000-0000-c000-000000000000')?$select=id,appId,displayName,appRoles,oauth2PermissionScopes,resourceSpecificApplicationPermissions
```
