# Create teams and manage members using the Microsoft Teams API

You can use the Microsoft Teams API in Microsoft Graph to create teams in multiple ways. This article describes the approach that we recommend for the best results.


## Create a team

All teams are backed by Microsoft 365 groups. The quickest way to get your team up and running when you create new teams via Microsoft Graph is to set up a new Microsoft 365 group, all owners and members, and convert that into a team.

1. Create a [Microsoft 365 group](https://support.office.com/article/learn-about-office-365-groups-b565caa1-5c40-40ef-9915-60fdb2d97fa2) using the [create group](/graph/api/group-post-groups) operation. You can specify owners and members. Make sure that you have the right owners for the newly created group, as described in Step 2.

    To create a team for this group, you need to set the following property values, as shown:

    - **groupTypes** = { "Unified" } 
    - **mailEnabled** = true
    - **securityEnabled** = false

    ```http
    POST /groups
    {
        "displayName":"Flight 157",
        "mailNickname":"flight157",
        "description":"Everything about flight 157",
        "visibility":"Private",
        "groupTypes":["Unified"],
        "mailEnabled":true,
        "securityEnabled":false,
        "members@odata.bind":[
            "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/users/bec05f3d-a818-4b58-8c2e-2b4e74b0246d",
            "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/users/ae67a4f4-2308-4522-9021-9f402ff0fba8",
            "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/users/eab978dd-35d0-4885-8c46-891b7d618783",
            "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/users/6a1272b5-f6fc-45c4-95fe-fe7c5a676133"
        ],
        "owners@odata.bind":[
            "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/users/6a1272b5-f6fc-45c4-95fe-fe7c5a676133",
            "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/users/eab978dd-35d0-4885-8c46-891b7d618783"
        ]
    }
    ```

    The following example shows the response. 

    >**Note:** The response object shown might be shortened for readability. All the properties will be returned from an actual call.

    ```http
    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Content-type: application/json
 
    {
        "@odata.context":"https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/$metadata#groups/$entity",
        "id":"b7f968af-ca51-42f6-a77e-82c7147bc8f2"
    }
    ```

2. Ensure the group has two or more owners. You can do so via the [add owner](/graph/api/group-post-owners) operation. These should be real user accounts and not service accounts. Having two owners helps handle cases where one owner leaves the company or is unavailable to perform team management operations.

3. Add all members (and guests if necessary) to the group using the [add member](/graph/api/group-post-members) operation, if you didn't do so in Step 1. If you're adding multiple members, add a 1 second delay after each add operation. 

4. After the group is successfully created, which can take up to 15 minutes after completing Step 1, create a Microsoft Teams team using the [create team from group](/graph/api/team-post#example-4-create-a-team-from-group) operation. If you run into an error, the group creation process might not be completed; try waiting a few more minutes. 

    ```http
    POST https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/teams
    Content-Type: application/json
    {
      "template@odata.bind": "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/teamsTemplates('standard')",
      "group@odata.bind": "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/groups('groupId')"
    }
    ```

    The following example shows the response. 

    >**Note:** The response object shown might be shortened for readability. All the properties will be returned from an actual call.

    ```http
    HTTP/1.1 202 Accepted
    Content-Type: application/json
    Location: /teams/{teamId}/operations/{operationId}
    Content-Location: /teams/{teamId}
    {
    }
    ```

    The created team has the same ID as the group.

5. After this process finishes, all owners and members should be able to see the newly created team in their Teams client.

## Add or manage members

To add members after a team is created, you use the [add member](/graph/api/group-post-members) operation. We recommend adding a 1 second delay between add operations. Note the following with respect to membership changes:

1. Membership changes made to Microsoft 365 groups sync to Teams via a background sync mechanism that typically takes 24 hours (or more in some cases).

2. The background process is triggered only if one or more users in the team (owner or member) is active in the Teams desktop client. Launching the Teams application and/or having it running constitutes activity â€” a user doesn't need to visit the team that is being modified specifically.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The Teams mobile clients don't trigger the membership sync. At least one user should be on the desktop client to that ensure this background process goes smoothly.

## Checklist for validation

After you create a team, you can use the following checklist to verify that the team was created successfully.

### Validate team creation

1. Verify that the Microsoft 365 group backing the team is created via the Microsoft Entra ID or Microsoft 365 admin centers.

2. Verify that the team creation succeeded via the Teams admin portal.

3. Verify that the team has the correct owners and members listed via the Teams admin portal.

4. Verify that the team owners can see the team after signing into the Teams desktop or web client.

5. Verify that members can see the team after signing into the Teams desktop or web client.

### Validate addition of members

1. Verify that newly members show up in the group via the Microsoft Entra ID or Microsoft 365 admin center.

2. Verify that newly added members can see the team after signing into the Teams desktop or web client.
