# Microsoft Graph Toolkit React components

The Microsoft Graph Toolkit React components (`mgt-react`) allow React developers to use the Microsoft Graph Toolkit in their React applications. The library wraps all Microsoft Graph Toolkit components and exports them as React components.

## What components can I use?

The library is autogenerated from the Microsoft Graph Toolkit web components and all components are available as React components.

The names of the React components are in PascalCase and do not include the `Mgt` prefix. For example, the `mgt-person` component is available as `Person`, and the `mgt-people-picker` component is available as `PeoplePicker`.

## Installation 

To install, use one of the following commands.

```bash
npm install @microsoft/mgt-react
```

or

```bash
yarn add @microsoft/mgt-react
```

## Usage

All components are available via the npm package and are named using PascalCase. To use a component, first import it at the top.

```tsx
import { Person } from '@microsoft/mgt-react';
```

You can now use `Person` anywhere in your JSX as a regular React component.

```tsx
<Person personQuery="me" />
```

All properties and events map exactly as they are defined in the component documentation.

For example, you can set the `personDetails` property to an object:

```jsx
const App = (props) => {
  const personDetails = {
    displayName: 'Bill Gates',
  };

  return <Person personDetails={personDetails}></Person>;
};
```

Or, register an event handler:

```jsx
import { PeoplePicker, People } from '@microsoft/mgt-react';

const App = (props) => {
  const [people, setPeople] = useState([]);

  const handleSelectionChanged = (e) => {
    setPeople(e.target.selectedPeople);
  };

  return
    <div>
      <PeoplePicker selectionChanged={handleSelectionChanged} />
      Selected People: <People people={people} />
    </div>;
};
```

## Templates

Most Microsoft Graph Toolkit components [support templating](../customize-components/templates.md) and `mgt-react` allows you to use React to write templates.

For example, to create a template to be used for rendering events in the `mgt-agenda` component, first define a component to be used for rendering an event:

```tsx
import { MgtTemplateProps } from '@microsoft/mgt-react';

const MyEvent = (props: MgtTemplateProps) => {
  const { event } = props.dataContext;
  return <div>{event.subject}</div>;
};
```

Then use it as a child of the wrapped component and set the template prop to `event`.

```tsx
import { Agenda } from '@microsoft/mgt-react';

const App = (props) => {
  return <Agenda>
    <MyEvent template="event">
  </Agenda>
}
```

The `template` prop allows you to specify which template to overwrite. In this case, the `MyEvent` component will be repeated for every event, and the `event` object will be passed as part of the `dataContext` prop.
