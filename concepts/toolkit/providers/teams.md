# Microsoft Teams provider

Use the Teams provider inside your Microsoft Teams tab to facilitate authentication and Microsoft Graph access to all components.

To learn more about authentication providers, see [providers](./providers.md).

>**Tip:** For details about how to get started with creating a Microsoft Teams application with the Teams Provider, see the [Build a Microsoft Teams tab](../get-started/build-a-microsoft-teams-tab.md) getting started guide.

## Get started

Before using the Teams provider, you will need to make sure you have referenced the [Microsoft Teams SDK](/javascript/api/overview/msteams-client?view=msteams-client-js-latest&preserve-view=true#using-the-sdk) in your page.

# [npm](#tab/ts)

Make sure to install both the toolkit and the Microsoft Teams SDK.

```cmd
npm install @microsoft/mgt @microsoft/teams-js
```

Next, import and use the provider.

```ts
import * as microsoftTeams from "@microsoft/teams-js";
import {Providers, TeamsProvider} from '@microsoft/mgt';

TeamsProvider.microsoftTeamsLib = microsoftTeams;
Providers.globalProvider = new TeamsProvider(config);
```

where `config` is

```ts
export interface TeamsConfig {
  clientId: string;
  authPopupUrl: string; // see below for creating the popup page
  scopes?: string[];
  msalOptions?: Configuration;
}
```

# [unpkg](#tab/html)

```html
<!-- Microsoft Teams sdk must be referenced before the toolkit -->
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@microsoft/teams-js/dist/MicrosoftTeams.min.js" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@microsoft/mgt/dist/bundle/mgt-loader.js"></script>

<mgt-teams-provider
  client-id="<YOUR_CLIENT_ID>"
  auth-popup-url="/AUTH-PATH"
  scopes="User.Read,People.Read..."
  authority=""
></mgt-teams-provider>
```

### mgt-teams-provider attributes
| Attribute | Description |
| --- | --- |
| client-id   | String client ID (see [Configure your Teams app](#configure-your-teams-app). Required. |
| auth-popup-url  | Absolute or relative path to the page that will handle auth in the popup (see [Create the popup page](#create-the-popup-page)). Required. |
| scopes  | Comma separated strings for scopes the user must consent to on sign in. Optional. |
| depends-on | Element selector string of another higher-priority provider component. Optional. |
| authority    | Authority string. The default is the common authority. For single-tenant apps, use your tenant ID or tenant name. For example, `https://login.microsoftonline.com/[your-tenant-name].onmicrosoft.com` or `https://login.microsoftonline.com/[your-tenant-id]`. Optional. |

### Create the popup page

In order to sign in with your Teams credentials, you need to provide a URL that the Teams app will open in a popup, which will follow the authentication flow. This URL needs to be in your domain, and it needs to call the `TeamsProvider.handleAuth();` method. That's the only thing that this page needs to do. For example:

# [npm](#tab/ts)

```ts
import * as microsoftTeams from "@microsoft/teams-js";
import {Providers, TeamsProvider} from '@microsoft/mgt';

TeamsProvider.microsoftTeamsLib = microsoftTeams;
TeamsProvider.handleAuth();
```

# [unpkg](#tab/html)

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@microsoft/teams-js/dist/MicrosoftTeams.min.js" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@microsoft/mgt/dist/bundle/mgt-loader.js"></script>

<script>
  mgt.TeamsProvider.handleAuth();
</script>
```
---

### Configure redirect URIs

After you publish the popup page on your website, you need to use the URL in the `auth-popup-url/authPopupUrl` property. This URL also needs to be configured as a valid redirect URI in your app configuration in the Azure AD portal.

## Configure your Teams app

If you're just getting started with Teams apps, see [Add tabs to Microsoft Teams apps](/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/tabs/tabs-overview). You can also use [App Studio](/microsoftteams/platform/get-started/get-started-app-studio) to quickly develop your app manifest.
### Creating an app/client ID
In order to get a client ID, you need to [register your application](../get-started/add-aad-app-registration.md) in Azure AD. 
>**Note**: MSAL only supports the Implicit Flow for OAuth. Make sure to enable Implicit Flow in your application in the Azure Portal (it is not enabled by default). Under **Authentication**, find the **Implicit grant** section and select the checkboxes for **Access tokens** and **ID tokens**.
