# Microsoft Graph Toolkit overview

Microsoft Graph Toolkit is a collection of reusable, framework-agnostic components and authentication providers for accessing and working with Microsoft Graph. The components are fully functional right of out of the box, with built-in providers that authenticate with and fetch data from Microsoft Graph.

Microsoft Graph Toolkit makes it easy to use Microsoft Graph in your application. In the following example, a signed-in user and their calendar events are displayed with just two lines of code by using the [Login](./components/login.md) and [Agenda](./components/agenda.md) components.

## Why use Microsoft Graph Toolkit?

Microsoft Graph Toolkit enables you to quickly and easily integrate common experiences powered by Microsoft Graph into your own application. The toolkit:

- **Cuts development time**. The work to connect to Microsoft Graph APIs and render the data in a UI that looks and feels like a Microsoft 365 experience is done for you, with no customization required.

- **Works everywhere**. All components are based on web standards and work seamlessly with any modern browser and web framework (such as React, Angular, or Vue).

- **Is beautiful but flexible**. The components are designed to look and feel like Microsoft 365 experiences but are also customizable by using [CSS custom properties](./customize-components/style.md) and [templating](./customize-components/templates.md).

## Who should use it?

Microsoft Graph Toolkit is great for developers of all experience levels that want to develop an app that connects to and accesses data from Microsoft Graph, such as a:

- Web app
- Microsoft Teams tab
- Progressive Web App (PWA)
- Electron app
- SharePoint web part

## What's in Microsoft Graph Toolkit?

### Components

Microsoft Graph Toolkit includes a collection of web components for the most commonly built experiences powered by Microsoft Graph APIs.

The components are also available as [React components](./get-started/mgt-react.md).

### Providers

[Providers](./providers/providers.md) enable authentication, provide the implementation for acquiring access tokens on various platforms, and expose a Microsoft Graph client for calling the Microsoft Graph APIs. The components work best when used with a provider, but the providers can be used on their own.

| Providers                               | Description                                                                                                                                |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |

| [Electron](./providers/electron.md)     | Authenticates and provides Microsoft Graph access to components inside of Electron apps.                                                   |
| [MSAL2](./providers/msal2.md)           | Uses msal-browser to sign in users and acquire tokens to use with Microsoft Graph.                                                         |
| [Proxy](./providers/proxy.md)           | Allows the use of backend authentication by routing all calls to Microsoft Graph through your backend.                                     |
| [SharePoint](./providers/sharepoint.md) | Authenticates and provides Microsoft Graph access to components inside of SharePoint web parts.                                            |
