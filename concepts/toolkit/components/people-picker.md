# People-Picker component

You can use the `mgt-people-picker` web component search for a specified number of people and render the list of results via Microsoft Graph. By default, the component will search for all people; you can also define a group property to further filter the results.

If the number of people to display exceeds the `show-max` value, not all people returned will be displayed in the search list.

## Example

[jsfiddle example](https://jsfiddle.net/metulev/jdv38fg0/)

```html
<mgt-people-picker></mgt-people-picker>
```

## Properties

By default, the `mgt-people-picker` component fetches events from the `/me/people` endpoint. Use the following attributes to change this behavior.

| Property | Attribute | Description                                                                                                                                                                            |
| -------- | --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| showMax  | show-max  | A number value to indicate the maximum number of people to show. the default value is 6.                                                                                             |
| people   | people    | An array of people to get or set the list of people rendered by the component. Use this property to access the people loaded by the component. Set this value to load your own people. |
| group    | group     | A string value that belongs to a Microsoft Graph defined group for further filtering of the search results.                                                                            |

The following is an example.

```html
<mgt-people-picker show-max="4"> </mgt-people-picker>
```
