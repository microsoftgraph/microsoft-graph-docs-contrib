# People picker component in Microsoft Graph Toolkit

You can use the `mgt-people-picker` web component to search for people, groups, or both. By default, the component searches for all people and users in the organization, but you can change the behavior to also search for groups, or only groups. You can also filter the search to a specific group. You can also allow the user to enter and select any email address.

## Example

The following example shows the `mgt-people-picker` component. Start searching for a name to see the results render and use the code editor to see how [properties](#properties) change the behavior of the component.

## Properties

By default, the `mgt-people-picker` component fetches people from the `/me/people` and `/users` endpoints. Use the following attributes to change this behavior.

| disable-images             | disableImages           | Sets whether to disable fetching and display of person images. When set to `true`, user initials are displayed instead. Default is `false`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| allow-any-email            | allowAnyEmail           | Indicates whether the people picker can accept email addresses without selecting a person. Default value is `false`. When you finish typing an email address, you can press comma (`,`), semicolon (`;`), tab or enter keys to add it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| user-ids                   | userIds                 | A string of comma-separated user IDs. They only appear on the dropdown menu or your search results when you type a query. For example, `48d31887-5fad-4d73-a9f5-3c356e68a038,24fcbca3-c3e2-48bf-9ffc-c7f81b81483d` only displays the two users in the dropdown when the input is focused. When you type a search text, it returns results that match the users in the two user IDs only.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| user-filters               | userFilters             | Specifies the filter criteria to use when querying the users' endpoint. It requires the `user-type` to be set to `user` or `contact`. By default, the `user-type` is `any` and leads the querying to take place in the `people` endpoint block. Example: `user-filters="startsWith(displayName,'a')"`. This attribute is optional. Learn more about [the support for filter on user properties of directory objects](/graph/aad-advanced-queries?tabs=http#user-properties). <br /> <br /> When you use only the `User.ReadBasic.All` permission, the list of available properties is limited and the component adapts accordingly. Under the [User.ReadBasic.All](/graph/permissions-reference#userreadbasicall) scope, you're limited to the following properties: `id`, `displayName`, `givenName`, `mail`, `securityIdentifier`, `surname`, and `userPrincipalName`. By default, this component uses the `jobTitle` and `department` properties. The `mail` property serves as a fallback for `jobTitle` when `User.ReadBasic.All` is in use and other properties aren't rendered. Use the `User.Read.All` permission to query more properties. |
| group-filters              | groupFilters            | Specifies the filter criteria to use when querying the `groups` endpoint. It requires the `type` to be set to `group`. Example: `group-filters="startsWith(displayName,'a')"`. This attribute is optional.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| people-filters             | peopleFilters           | Specifies the filter criteria to use when querying the `people` endpoint. It's used as it is. Example: `people-filters="jobTitle eq 'Web Marketing Manager'"`. This attribute is optional. Learn more about [filtering and the supported capabilities on the people resource](/graph/people-insights-overview).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| group-ids                  | groupIds                | A string of comma-separated group IDs. The available results should be limited to the specified groups. Users that appear on the dropdown menu and via the search experience should only come from the specified group IDs. For example, `02bd9fd6-8f93-4758-87c3-1fb73740a315,06f62f70-9827-4e6e-93ef-8e0f2d9b7b23` only displays users belonging to these groups. When you type a search text, it returns results that match the users in the two group IDs only. This property isn't used if `group-id` is defined. If the property is set, the `type` is `group` by default and `transitive-search` is `true` by default. If the `group-type` is set with the property, the `type` can be `any` or `group`. If the `type` is `person`, the property isn't used. |
| aria-label                 | ariaLabel               | A string provided to help assistive technologies provide context for the people picker.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

The following example shows the `show-max` attribute.

```html
<mgt-people-picker show-max="4"> </mgt-people-picker>
```

## Selected people

The selected people section of the component renders each person chosen by the developer or user.

![mgt-people-picker](./images/selected-people.png)

You can populate selected people data with the following options:

- Setting the `selectedPeople` property directly, as shown in the following example.

  ```javascript
  // personObject is the User or Person object from Microsoft Graph
  document.querySelector("mgt-people-picker").selectedPeople.push(personObject);
  ```

- Using the `selectUsersById()` method, which accepts an array of Microsoft graph [user IDs](/graph/api/resources/users) to find associated user details for selection.

  > **Note:** If no user is found for an `id`, no data will be rendered for that `id`.

  ```javascript
  // id = Microsoft graph User "id"
  document.querySelector("mgt-people-picker").selectUsersById(["id", "id"]);
  ```

- Using the `selectGroupsById()` method, which accepts an array of Microsoft graph [group IDs](/graph/api/resources/group) to find the group(s) with associated users.

  ```javascript
  // groupid = Microsoft graph group "id"
  document
    .querySelector("mgt-people-picker")
    .selectGroupsById(["groupid", "groupid"]);
  ```

## CSS custom properties

The `mgt-people-picker` component defines the following CSS custom properties.

```html
<mgt-people-picker class="people-picker"></mgt-people-picker>
```

## Events

The following events are fired from the component.

| Event              | When is it emitted                                                         | Custom data                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Cancelable | Bubbles |          Works with custom template           |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------: | :-----: | :-------------------------------------------: |
| `selectionChanged` | The user added or removed a person from the list of selected/picked people | Array of selected people, where a person can be a Graph [user](/graph/api/resources/user), [person](/graph/api/resources/person) or [contact](/graph/api/resources/contact) with another `personImage` property that contains the URL of the user's photo |     No     |   No    | Yes, unless you override the default template |

For more information about handling events, see [events](../customize-components/events.md).

## Templates

`mgt-people-picker` supports several [templates](../customize-components/templates.md) that you can use to replace certain parts of the component. To specify a template, include a `<template>` element inside a component and set the `data-type` to one of the following values.

| Data type       | Data context                      | Description                                                                           |
| --------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| default         | null: no data                     | The template used to override the rendering of the entire component.                  |
| loading         | null: no data                     | The template used to render the state of picker while request to graph is being made. |
| error           | null: no data                     | The template used if user search returns no users.                                    |
| no-data         | null: no data                     | An alternative template used if user search returns no users.                         |
| selected-person | person: The person details object | The template to render selected people.                                               |
| person          | person: The person details object | The template to render people in the dropdown.                                        |

The following examples show how to use the `error` template.

```html
<mgt-people-picker>
  <template data-type="error">
    <p>Sorry, no people were found</p>
  </template>
</mgt-people-picker>
```

## Microsoft Graph permissions

This component might make many queries depending on configuration and state. The following table splits the Microsoft Graph APIs and permissions that are required into three sections for simplicity. For each API called, the user must have at least one of the permissions listed.

### Regardless of the user input state

| Configuration                                                                                          | Permission                                                                                                | API                                      |  Additional options |

### Subcomponents

The `mgt-people-picker` component consists of one or more subcomponents that might require other permissions than the ones listed previously. For more information, see the documentation for each subcomponent: [mgt-person](person.md).

## Authentication

The control uses the global authentication provider described in the [authentication documentation](../providers/providers.md).

## Cache

| Object store | Cached data    | Remarks                                                            |
| ------------ | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `groups`     | List of groups | Used when `type` is set to `PersonType.group`                      |
| `people`     | List of people | Used when `type` is set to `PersonType.person` or `PersonType.any` |
| `users`      | List of users  | Used when `groupId` specified                                      |

For more information about how to configure the cache, see [Caching](../customize-components/cache.md).

## Extend for more control

For more complex scenarios or a truly custom UX, this component exposes several `protected render*` methods for override in component extensions.

| Method               | Description                                                       |

| renderSelectedPeople | Renders the selected people tokens.                               |
| renderSelectedPerson | Renders an individual person token.                               |
| renderFlyout         | Renders the flyout chrome.                                        |
| renderFlyoutContent  | Renders the appropriate state in the results flyout.              |
| renderLoading        | Renders the loading state.                                        |
| renderNoData         | Renders the state when no results are found for the search query. |
| renderSearchResults  | Renders the list of search results.                               |
| renderPersonResult   | Renders an individual person search result.                       |

## Localization

The control exposes the following variables that can be localized. For details about localization, see [Localizing components](../customize-components/localization.md).

| String name              | Default value                        |
