# Get component in the Microsoft Graph Toolkit

You can use `mgt-get` to make any GET query from Microsoft Graph directly in your HTML. The component does not provide a default UI and requires that you write a template.

## Example

The following example shows the use of the `mgt-get` component to display a user's emails. You can use the code editor to see how [properties and attributes](#properties-and-attributes) change the behavior of the component.

## Properties and attributes

You can use several attributes to change the behavior of the component. The only required attribute is `resource`.

| Attribute | Property  | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| resource | resource | The resource to get from Microsoft Graph (for example, `/me`). |
| scopes | scopes | Optional array of strings if using the property or a comma delimited scope if using the attribute. The component will use these scopes (with a supported provider) to ensure that the user has consented to the right permission. |
| version | version | Optional API version to use when making the GET request. Default is `v1.0`.  |
| max-pages | maxPages | Optional number of pages (for resources that support paging). Default is 3. Setting this value to 0 will get all pages.  |
| polling-rate | pollingRate | Optional number of milliseconds. When set, the component will poll the request URI for updates in the defined interval. If using a delta query, polling will always query the delta API. The template will only refresh when the data changes. |
| cache-enabled | cacheEnabled | Optional Boolean. When set, it indicates that the response from the resource will be cached. Overriden if `refresh()` is called or if `pollingRate` is in use. Default is `false`. |
| cache-invalidation-period | cacheInvalidationPeriod | Optional number of milliseconds. When set in combination with `cacheEnabled`, the delay before the cache reaches its invalidation period will be modified by this value. Default is `0` and will use the default invalidation period. |
| type | type | Optional type of the expected response. Default is `json`. Supports `json` or `image` (only be supported on endpoints ending with `/photo/value$`). |
| N/A | response | Read-only response from Microsoft Graph if request was successful.  |
| N/A |error| Read-only error from Microsoft Graph if request was not successful. |

## Methods

| Method | Description |
| --- | --- |
| refresh(force?:boolean) | Call the method to refresh the data. By default, the UI will only update if the data changes. Pass `true` to force the component to update.  |

## Events

Event | When is it emitted | Custom data | Cancelable | Bubbles | Works with custom template
------|-------------------|--------------|:-----------:|:---------:|:---------------------------:|
`dataChange` | Fired after the component loaded its data. | `{ response: any, error: any }`. The `response` property contains the response retrieved from Microsoft Graph. The `error` property contains information about the error if one occurred | No | No | Yes

> [!TIP]
> For more information about the data returned in the `response` property see the API reference of the API that you used in the `resource` property of the Get component.

For more information about handling events, see [events](../customize-components/events.md).

## Templates

The `mgt-get` component supports several [templates](../customize-components/templates.md) that you can use to define the look and feel. To specify a template, include a `<template>` element inside a component and set the `data-type` value to one of the following.

| Data type | Data context | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| default | The response from Microsoft Graph. | The default template is required to render the data coming from Microsoft Graph. |
| value | Data item from the returned `value` array | Use the `value` template instead of the `default` template when expecting the response from the graph to contain an array of items - such as **messages**, **files**, or **users**. The `value` template will automatically be repeated for each item returned by the resource. The `value` template will also start rendering the items as soon as they are ready (unlike the default template).|
| error | The error from Microsoft Graph. | This template will be used if there is an error making the request. |
| loading | N/A | This template is used while the request is being made. |

## Microsoft Graph permissions

Permissions required by this component depend on the data that you want to retrieve with it from Microsoft Graph. For more information about permissions, see the Microsoft Graph [permissions reference](../../permissions-reference.md).

## Authentication

The control uses the global authentication provider described in the [authentication documentation](../providers/providers.md) to fetch the required data.

## Cache

To enable and configure the cache, use the `cacheEnabled` and `cacheInvalidationPeriod` properties. By default, the `mgt-get` component does not cache any responses.

|Object store|Cached data|Remarks|
|-----------|-----------|-------|
|`response`|Complete response retrieved from Microsoft Graph for the query specified in the `resource` property of `mgt-get`|

See [Caching](../customize-components/cache.md) for more details.
