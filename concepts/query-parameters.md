# Use query parameters to customize responses

Microsoft Graph supports optional query parameters that you can use to specify and control the amount of data returned in a response. The support for the exact query parameters varies from one API operation to another, and depending on the API, can differ between the v1.0 and beta endpoints.

> [!TIP] 
> On the beta endpoint, the `$` prefix is optional. For example, instead of `$filter`, you can use `filter`. 
> On the v1 endpoint, the `$` prefix is optional for only a subset of APIs. For simplicity, always include `$` if using the v1 endpoint.

Query parameters can be OData system query options or other query parameters.

## OData system query options
A Microsoft Graph API operation might support one or more of the following OData system query options. These query options are compatible with the [OData V4 query language][odata-query].

>**Note:** OData 4.0 supports system query options in only GET operations.

| Name                     | Description | Example
|:-------------------------|:------------|:---------|
| [$count](#count-parameter)         | Retrieves the total count of matching resources. | [`/me/messages?$top=2&$count=true`][count-example]
| [$expand](#expand-parameter)       | Retrieves related resources.|[`/groups?$expand=members`][expand-example]
| [$filter](#filter-parameter)       | Filters results (rows).|[`/users?$filter=startswith(givenName,'J')`][filter-example]
| [$format](#format-parameter)       | Returns the results in the specified media format.|[`/users?$format=json`][format-example]
| [$orderby](#orderby-parameter)     | Orders results.|[`/users?$orderby=displayName desc`][orderby-example]
| [$search](#search-parameter)       | Returns results based on search criteria. |[`/me/messages?$search=pizza`][search-example]
| [$select](#select-parameter)       | Filters properties (columns).|[`/users?$select=givenName,surname`][select-example]
| [$skip](#skip-parameter)           | Indexes into a result set. Also used by some APIs to implement paging and can be used together with `$top` to manually page results. | [`/me/messages?$skip=11`][skip-example]
| [$top](#top-parameter)             | Sets the page size of results. |[`/users?$top=2`][top-example]


## Other query parameters

| Name                     | Description | Example
|:-------------------------|:------------|:---------|
| [$skipToken](#skiptoken-parameter) | Retrieves the next page of results from result sets that span multiple pages. (Some APIs use `$skip` instead.) | `/users?$skiptoken=X%274453707402000100000017...`|

## Other OData URL capabilities

The following OData 4.0 capabilities are URL segments, not query parameters.

| Name                     | Description | Example 
|:-------------------------|:------------|:---------|
| [$count](/graph/api/user-list#example-3-get-only-a-count-of-users)| Retrieves the integer total of the collection. | `GET /users/$count` <br> `GET /groups/{id}/members/$count`|
| [$ref](/graph/api/group-post-members) | Updates entities membership to a collection. | `POST /groups/{id}/members/$ref` |
| [$value](/graph/api/profilephoto-get) | Retrieves or updates the binary value of an item. | `GET /me/photo/$value` |

## Encoding query parameters

The values of query parameters should be percent-encoded. Many HTTP clients, browsers, and tools (such as the [Graph Explorer][graph-explorer]) will help you with this. If a query is failing, one possible cause is failure to encode the query parameter values appropriately.

An unencoded URL looks like this:

```http
GET https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/users?$filter=startswith(givenName, 'J')
```

A properly encoded URL looks like this:

```http
GET https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/users?$filter=startswith(givenName%2C+'J')
```

### Escaping single quotes

For requests that use single quotes, if any parameter values also contain single quotes, those must be double escaped; otherwise, the request will fail due to invalid syntax. In the example, the string value `let''s meet for lunch?` has the single quote escaped.

```http
GET https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me/messages?$filter=subject eq 'let''s meet for lunch?'
```

## count parameter

Use the `$count` query parameter to include a count of the total number of items in a collection alongside the page of data values returned from Microsoft Graph.

> [!NOTE]
> `$count` can also be used as a [URL segment](#other-odata-url-capabilities) to retrieve the integer total of the collection. On resources that derive from [directoryObject](/graph/api/resources/directoryobject), is it only supported in an advanced query. See [Advanced query capabilities in Azure AD directory objects](/graph/aad-advanced-queries).
>
> Use of `$count` is not supported in Azure AD B2C tenants.

For example, the following request returns both the **contact** collection of the current user, and the number of items in the **contact** collection in the `@odata.count` property.

```msgraph-interactive
GET  https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me/contacts?$count=true
```

The `$count` query parameter is supported for these collections of resources and their relationships that derive from [directoryObject](/graph/api/resources/directoryobject) and only in [advanced queries](/graph/filter-directory-objects):
- [application](/graph/api/resources/application)
- [orgContact](/graph/api/resources/orgcontact)
- [device](/graph/api/resources/device)
- [group](/graph/api/resources/group)
- [servicePrincipal](/graph/api/resources/serviceprincipal)
- [user](/graph/api/resources/user)

## expand parameter

Many Microsoft Graph resources expose both declared properties of the resource as well as its relationships with other resources. These relationships are also called reference properties or navigation properties, and they can reference either a single resource or a collection of resources. For example, the mail folders, manager, and direct reports of a user are all exposed as relationships. 

Normally, you can query either the properties of a resource or one of its relationships in a single request, but not both. You can use the `$expand` query string parameter to include the expanded resource or collection referenced by a single relationship (navigation property) in your results. Only one relationship can be expanded in a single request.

The following example gets root drive information along with the top-level child items in a drive:

```msgraph-interactive
GET https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me/drive/root?$expand=children
```


With some resource collections, you can also specify the properties to be returned in the expanded resources by adding a `$select` parameter. The following example performs the same query as the previous example but uses a [`$select`](#select-parameter) statement to limit the properties returned for the expanded child items to the **id** and **name** properties.

```msgraph-interactive
GET https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me/drive/root?$expand=children($select=id,name)
```

> [!NOTE]
> Not all relationships and resources support the `$expand` query parameter. For example, you can expand the **directReports**, **manager**, and **memberOf** relationships on a user, but you cannot expand its **events**, **messages**, or **photo** relationships. Not all resources or relationships support using `$select` on expanded items. 
> 
> With Azure AD resources that derive from [directoryObject](/graph/api/resources/directoryobject), like [user](/graph/api/resources/user) and [group](/graph/api/resources/group), `$expand` typically returns a maximum of 20 items for the expanded relationship and has no [@odata.nextLink](./paging.md). See more [known issues](known-issues.md#query-parameter-limitations).

## filter parameter

Use the `$filter` query parameter to retrieve just a subset of a collection. The `$filter` query parameter can also be used to retrieve relationships like members, memberOf, transitiveMembers, and transitiveMemberOf. For example, get all the security groups I'm a member of.

The following example finds users whose display name starts with the letter 'J':

```msgraph-interactive
GET https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/users?$filter=startsWith(displayName,'J')
```

Support for `$filter` operators varies across Microsoft Graph APIs. The following logical operators are generally supported:

| Operator type | Operator |
| --- | --- |
| Equality operators | <ul><li> equals `eq` </li><li> not equals `ne`</li><li> Negation `not`</li><li> in `in`</li></ul> |
| Relational operators | <ul><li> less than `lt` </li><li> greater than `gt`</li><li> less than or equal to `le`</li><li> greater than or equal to `ge`</li></ul> |
| Lambda operators | <ul><li> any `any` </li><li> all `all`</li></ul>|
| Conditional operators | <ul><li> and `and` </li><li> or `or`</li> |
| Functions | <ul><li> Starts with `startsWith` </li><li> Ends with `endsWith`</li><li> Contains `contains`</li></ul>|


> **Note:** Support for these operators varies by entity and some properties support `$filter` only in [advanced queries](/graph/aad-advanced-queries). See the specific entity documentation for details.

### Filter using lambda operators

OData defines the `any` and `all` operators to evaluate matches on multi-valued properties, that is, either collection of primitive values such as String types or collection of entities.

The `any` operator iteratively applies a Boolean expression to each member of a collection and returns `true` if the expression is `true` for *any member* of the collection, otherwise it returns `false`. The following is the syntax of the `any` operator:

```http
$filter=param/any(var:var/subparam eq 'value-to-match')
```

Where
+ *param* is the property that contains a collection of values or a collection of entities.
+ *var:var* is a range variable that holds the current element of the collection during iteration. This variable can be named almost anything, for example, *adele:adele* or *x:x*.
+ *subparam* is required when the query applies to a collection of entities. It represents the property of the complex type whose value we are matching.
+ *value-to-match* represents the member of the collection against which we are matching.

For example, the **imAddresses** property of the user resource contains a collection of primitive type String. The following query retrieves only users with an imAddress of `admin@contoso.com`.

```msgraph-interactive
GET https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/users?$filter=imAddresses/any(s:s eq 'admin@contoso.com')
```

The **assignedLicenses** property of the user resource contains a collection of **assignedLicense** objects, a complex type with two properties, **skuId** and **disabledPlans**. The following query retrieves only users with an assigned license identified by the **skuId** `184efa21-98c3-4e5d-95ab-d07053a96e67`.

```msgraph-interactive
GET https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/users?$filter=assignedLicenses/any(s:s/skuId eq 184efa21-98c3-4e5d-95ab-d07053a96e67)
```

To negate the result of the expression inside the `any` clause, use the `NOT` operator, not the `ne` operator. For example, the following query retrieves only users who are not assigned the **imAddress** of `admin@contoso.com`.
>**Note:** For directory objects like users, the `NOT` and `ne` operators are supported only in [advanced queries](/graph/aad-advanced-queries).

```msgraph-interactive
GET https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/users?$filter=NOT(imAddresses/any(s:s eq 'admin@contoso.com'))&$count=true
ConsistencyLevel: eventual
```

The `all` operator applies a Boolean expression to each member of a collection and returns `true` if the expression is `true` for *all members* of the collection, otherwise it returns `false`. It is not supported by any property.

### Examples using the filter query operator

The following table shows some examples that use the `$filter` query parameter. For more details about `$filter` syntax, see the [OData protocol][odata-filter].

This is an [advanced query](/graph/aad-advanced-queries). |

## format parameter

Use the `$format` query parameter to specify the media format of the items returned from Microsoft Graph.

For example, the following request returns the users in the organization in the json format:

```msgraph-interactive
GET https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/users?$format=json
```


> **Note:** The `$format` query parameter supports a number of formats (for example, atom, xml, and json) but results may not be returned in all formats.

## orderby parameter

Use the `$orderby` query parameter to specify the sort order of the items returned from Microsoft Graph. The default order is ascending order.

For example, the following request returns the users in the organization ordered by their display name:

```msgraph-interactive
GET https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/users?$orderby=displayName
```

You can also sort by complex type entities. The following request gets messages and sorts them by the **address** field of the **from** property, which is of the complex type **emailAddress**:

```msgraph-interactive
GET https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me/messages?$orderby=from/emailAddress/address
```

To sort the results in ascending or descending order, append either `asc` or `desc` to the field name, separated by a space; for example, `?$orderby=name%20desc`. If the sort order is not specified, the default (ascending order) is inferred.

With some APIs, you can order results on multiple properties. For example, the following request orders the messages in the user's Inbox, first by the name of the person who sent it in descending order (Z to A), and then by subject in ascending order (default).

```msgraph-interactive
GET https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me/mailFolders/Inbox/messages?$orderby=from/emailAddress/name desc,subject
```

> **Note:** When you specify `$filter` the server will infer a sort order for the results. If you use both `$orderby` and `$filter` to get messages, because the server always infers 
a sort order for the results of a `$filter`, you must [specify properties in certain ways](/graph/api/user-list-messages#using-filter-and-orderby-in-the-same-query).


The following example shows a query filtered by the **subject** and **importance** properties, and then sorted by the **subject**, **importance**, and 
**receivedDateTime** properties in descending order.

```msgraph-interactive
GET https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me/messages?$filter=Subject eq 'welcome' and importance eq 'normal'&$orderby=subject,importance,receivedDateTime desc
```


> [!NOTE] 
> Combining `$orderby` and `$filter` query parameters is supported for directory objects. See [Advanced query capabilities in Azure AD directory objects](/graph/aad-advanced-queries).

## search parameter

Use the `$search` query parameter to restrict the results of a request to match a search criterion. It's syntax and behavior varies from one API operation to another. To see the syntax for `$search` across different resources, see [Use the $search query parameter to match a search criterion](/graph/search-query-parameter).

## select parameter

Use the `$select` query parameter to return a set of properties that are different than the default set for an individual resource or a collection of resources. With `$select`, you can specify a subset or a superset of the default properties.

For example, when retrieving the messages of the signed-in user, you can specify that only the **from** and **subject** properties be returned:

```msgraph-interactive
GET https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me/messages?$select=from,subject
```


> **Important:** In general, we recommend that you use `$select` to limit the properties returned by a query to those needed by your app. This is especially true of queries that might potentially return a large result set. Limiting the properties returned in each row will reduce network load and help improve your app's performance.
>
> In `v1.0`, some Azure AD resources that derive from [directoryObject](/graph/api/resources/directoryobject), like [user](/graph/api/resources/user) and [group](/graph/api/resources/group), return a limited, default subset of properties on reads. For these resources, you must use `$select` to return properties outside of the default set.  

## skip parameter

Use the `$skip` query parameter to set the number of items to skip at the start of a collection.
For example, the following request returns events for the user sorted by date created, starting with the 21st event in the collection:

```msgraph-interactive
GET  https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me/events?$orderby=createdDateTime&$skip=20
```


> **Note:** Some Microsoft Graph APIs, like Outlook Mail and Calendars (**message**, **event**, and **calendar**), use `$skip` to implement paging. When results of a query span multiple pages, these APIs will return an `@odata:nextLink` property with a URL that contains a `$skip` parameter. You can use this URL to return the next page of results. To learn more, see [Paging](./paging.md).
>
> The **ConsistencyLevel** header required for advanced queries against directory objects is not included by default in subsequent page requests. It must be set explicitly in subsequent pages.

## skipToken parameter

Some requests return multiple pages of data, either due to server-side paging or due to the use of the [`$top`](#top-parameter) parameter to limit the page size of the response. Many Microsoft Graph APIs use the `skipToken` query parameter to reference subsequent pages of the result.  
The `$skiptoken` parameter contains an opaque token that references the next page of results and is returned in the URL provided in the `@odata.nextLink` property in the response. To learn more, see [Paging](./paging.md).
> **Note:** If you're using OData Count (adding `$count=true` in the query string) for queries against directory objects, the `@odata.count` property is present only in the first page.
>
> The **ConsistencyLevel** header required for advanced queries against directory objects is not included by default in subsequent page requests. It must be set explicitly in subsequent pages.

## top parameter

Use the `$top` query parameter to specify the page size of the result set. 

If more items remain in the result set, the response body will contain an `@odata.nextLink` parameter. This parameter contains a URL that you can use to get the next page of results. To learn more, see [Paging](./paging.md). 

The minimum value of $top is 1 and the maximum depends on the corresponding API.  

For example, the following [list messages](/graph/api/user-list-messages) request returns the first five messages in the user's mailbox:

```msgraph-interactive
GET https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me/messages?$top=5
```


> The **ConsistencyLevel** header required for advanced queries against directory objects is not included by default in subsequent page requests. It must be set explicitly in subsequent pages.

## Error handling for query parameters

Some requests will return an error message if a specified query parameter is not supported. For example, you cannot use `$expand` on the `user/photo` relationship. 

```http
https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me?$expand=photo
```

```json
{
    "error":{
        "code":"ExpandNotSupported",
        "message":"Expand is not allowed for property 'Photo' according to the entity schema.",
        "innerError":{
            "request-id":"1653fefd-bc31-484b-bb10-8dc33cb853ec",
            "date":"2017-07-31T20:55:01"
        }
    }
}
```

However, it is important to note that query parameters specified in a request might fail silently. This can be true for unsupported query parameters as well as for unsupported combinations of query parameters. In these cases, you should examine the data returned by the request to determine whether the query parameters you specified had the desired effect.
