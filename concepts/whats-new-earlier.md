# Highlights of earlier releases

## May - June, 2019: New and generally available

### Calendar, mail, and personal contacts
Exchange administrators can grant application permissions to an app and [limit the app to access only a subset of mailboxes](auth-limit-mailbox-access.md), instead of the default which is access to all mailboxes in the organization. Such restricted access would apply to any application permissions granted to the app for [calendars](permissions-reference.md#calendars-permissions), [contacts](permissions-reference.md#contacts-permissions), and [mail and mailbox settings](permissions-reference.md#mail-permissions). See related [blog announcement](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/blogs/scoping-microsoft-graph-application-permissions-to-specific-exchange-online-mailboxes/).

### Mail
Use [mail search folders](/graph/api/resources/mailsearchfolder?view=graph-rest-1.0) API to search messages and access Outlook email search results. See related [blog announcement](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/blogs/mail-search-folder-support-for-microsoft-graph-apis/).

### Postman
As an alternative to Graph Explorer, try the Microsoft Graph API on the [Microsoft Graph Postman collection](use-postman.md) to learn the API behavior and speed up app development.

### Tutorials
Try the new [tutorial to build a Java console app](/graph/tutorials/java) to get information about a user calendar.

### User
Administrators or users can [revoke](/graph/api/user-revokesigninsessions?view=graph-rest-1.0) all issued refresh tokens for a user. This is usually used to prevent apps on a lost or stolen device from accessing an organization's data.


## May - June, 2019: New in preview

### Microsoft Graph toolkit
The [Microsoft Graph toolkit](/graph/toolkit/overview) is a set of framework-agnostic web components and helpers that provides convenience to authenticate and access data in Microsoft Graph. Because the Microsoft Graph toolkit is in preview status, use toolkit providers and components in only non-production apps.
