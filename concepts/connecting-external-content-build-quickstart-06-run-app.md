In this step, you will build and run the sample. This code sample will create a new connection, register the schema, then push items from the [ApplianceParts.csv](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/msgraph-search-connector-sample/blob/master/ApplianceParts.csv) file into that connection.

1. Open your command-line interface (CLI) in the PartsInventoryConnector directory.
2. Use the command: `dotnet build` to build the sample.
3. Use the command: `dotnet run` to run the sample.
4. Select "**1. Create a connection**". Enter a unique identifier, name, and description for that connection.
5. Select "**2. Register schema for the current connection option**" Then, wait for the operation to complete.
6. Select "**3. Push all items to current connection**.

  > [!NOTE]
  > If step 5 results in error, wait a few minutes, and then select "**3. Push all items to current connection**".
