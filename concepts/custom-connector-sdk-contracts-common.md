# Copilot connectors SDK common models

This article describes the common models used in the Microsoft 365 Copilot connectors (formerly Microsoft Graph connectors) SDK.

## CustomConfiguration

**Search Admin** provides the connector-specific custom configuration information during the connection creation. The platform doesn't manage the structure and format of the configuration. Connector developers can use a format of their choice.

|Property |Type |Description |
|:----------|:-------------|:----------|
|configuration |string |Holds the configuration information as a string. The connector should have the capability to interpret the content of the string. |

## AuthenticationType enumeration members

The following table lists the members of the **AuthenticationType** enumeration.

|Member |Value |Description |
|:----------|:-------------|:----------|
|Anonymous |0 |No authentication is required to access the data source. |
|Basic |1 |Basic Authentication in the form of username and password to access the data source. |
|Windows |2 |Windows Active Directory-based authentication supports username, password, and domain info. |
|oAuth2ClientCredential |3 |OAuth2 based authentication with client credentials. It supports application ID and application secret. |

## AuthenticationData

Contains credentials provided by the admin to access the data source, including the authentication type, data source URL, and the credentials data.

|Property |Type |Description |
|:----------|:-------------|:----------|
|authType |[AuthenticationType](#authenticationtype-enumeration-members) |Type of authentication information held in this object. |
|DatasourceUrl |string |URL or path to access data source - path to the resource that needs to be crawled. Example: Connection string for a database. |
|basicCredential |[BasicCredential](#basiccredential) |Credentials in the form of username and password to access the data source. This property will be set exclusive to **windowsCredential**, and the **authType** will be set to Basic when this property is set. |
|windowsCredential |[WindowsCredential](#windowscredential) |Credentials in the form of Windows AD username, password, and domain to access the data source. This property will be set exclusive to **basicCredential**, and the **authType** will be set to Windows when this property is set. |
|oAuth2ClientCredential |[oAuth2ClientCredential](#oauth2clientcredential) |Credentials in the form of app ID and app secret for OAuth client credentials based authentication for accessing the datasource. This property will be set exclusive to **oAuth2ClientCredential** and the **authType** will be set to **oAuth2ClientCredential** when this property is set. |

## BasicCredential

Represents the basic credentials model.

|Property |Type |Description |
|:----------|:-------------|:----------|
|username |string |Username for accessing the data source. |
|secret |string |Secret to use with the username for accessing data source. |

## WindowsCredential

## oAuth2ClientCredentialResponse

Represents the response model from the authentication server for the OAuth2 token request. The fields present in this model are the common response fields specified in OAuth2 documentation. Additionally, **idToken** can be set when the auth servers support **OpenIDConnect**.

|Property |Type |Description |
|:----------|:-------------|:----------|
|accessToken |string |The access token from auth server. |
|refreshToken |string |The refresh token if auth server sends it. |
|tokenType |string |Type of the token â€“ usually Bearer token for OAuth. |

|SkipItem |8 |To be used in the crawl flow when item is to be skipped. |

## OperationStatus

Represents the status of an operation, including error/warnings and retry details. This model is part of the response of all APIs in [ConnectionManagementService](/graph/custom-connector-sdk-contracts-connectionmanagement) and [ConnectorCrawlerService](/graph/custom-connector-sdk-contracts-connectorcrawler).

|Property |Type |Description |
|:----------|:-------------|:----------|
|result |[OperationResult](#operationresult) |Result of the operation. |
|statusMessage |string |Custom message that can be used for logging and monitoring purposes. |
|retryInfo |[RetryDetails](#retrydetails) |Retry information to be used by the framework to retry the same operation for a failed operation. If the operation succeeds or partially succeeds, it will ignore. |

## RetryType enumeration members

This enumeration is used to define the strategy for retrying in case of errors.

|Member |Value |Description |
|:----------|:-------------|:----------|
|NoRetry |0 | No retry has to be made. |
|Standard |1 | Standard retry with linear wait time will be made. |
|ExponentialBackOff |2 | Retry by exponential backoff will be made. |

|backoffRate |float |Gets the backoffRate used in the calculation of Exponential Backoff. |

## DataSourceSchema

Represents the schema of the properties that represent a data entity in the data source. For details, see [schema resource type](/graph/api/resources/externalconnectors-schema).

|Property |Type |Description |
|:----------|:-------------|:----------|
|PropertyList |repeated [SourcePropertyDefinition](#sourcepropertydefinition) |Represents list of properties that define an item in data source. |

## SourcePropertyType enumeration members

|Member |Value |Description |
|:----------|:-------------|:----------|
|String |0 | Property of type **string**. |
|Int64 |1 | Property of type **int64** (long). |

## SearchAnnotations enumeration members

|Member |Value |Description |
|:----------|:-------------|:----------|
|None |0 |None |
|IsSearchable |1 |If a property is searchable, its value is added to the full-text index. When a user performs a search, results are returned if there's a search hit in one of the searchable fields or its content. For example, if the property is "Author," searching "Smith" returns items whose Author property contains "Smith." |
|IsQueryable |2 |If a property is queryable, you can query against it using Knowledge Query Language (KQL). KQL consists of one or more free text keywords (words or phrases) or property restrictions. The property name must be included in the query, either specified in the query itself or included in the query programmatically. You can use prefix matching with the wildcard operator(\*). For example, if the property is "Author," the search query can be "Author: Smith" |
|IsRetrievable |4 |If a property is retrievable, it can return its value in search results. Any property you want to add to the display template or return from the query and be relevant in search results must be retrievable. Marking large or too many properties as retrievable will increase search latency. Be selective and choose relevant properties. |
|IsContent |8 |Content property is to identify a property that can be full text indexed. Admins will choose among the available properties, which one should be the property to be treated as content for that specific connection. For details, see [Content property](/graph/connecting-external-content-manage-items#content). |
|IsRefinable |16 |If a property is refinable, an admin can configure it as a custom filter on the Microsoft Search results page. A refinable property can't be searchable. |

> [!NOTE]
> If a connection has the **Title** and **Url** semantic labels, and any schema property in the connection is marked as **IsContent**, the content of the item is vectorized in the semantic index.

## SearchPropertyLabel

Search property labels are well-known tags published by Microsoft that you can add against a property in your schema. Adding a semantic label helps various Microsoft products understand the property and provide a better experience. For details, see [Semantic labels](/graph/connecting-external-content-manage-schema#semantic-labels).

### SearchPropertyLabel enumeration members

|ContainerName |13 |Name of the container. |
|ContainerUrl |14 | The URL of the container. |
|IconUrl | 15 |The URL of an icon. |
