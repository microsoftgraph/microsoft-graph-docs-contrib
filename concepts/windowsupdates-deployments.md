# Deployments in Windows Autopatch

Deployments are the foundation of Windows Autopatch. Through a deployment, you can target a set of devices to receive specific content from Windows Update, such as a [software update](windowsupdates-software-updates.md).

Deployments have the following key aspects:

1. Content: The update available to deploy from the catalog. This is represented by the **content** property of the [deployableContent](/graph/api/resources/windowsupdates-deployablecontent) type.
2. Audience: The devices to receive content. This is an **audience** relationship of the [deploymentAudience](/graph/api/resources/windowsupdates-deploymentaudience) type.
3. Policy: The entity that governs the deployment of content to an associated deployment audience.  This is a **policy** relationship of the [updatePolicy](/graph/api/resources/windowsupdates-updatepolicy) type.
4. Settings: The settings governing how and when content should be delivered to devices. This is represented by the **settings** property of the [deploymentSettings](/graph/api/resources/windowsupdates-deploymentsettings) type.
5. State: The current state of the deployment within its lifecycle. This is represented by the **state** property of the [deploymentState](/graph/api/resources/windowsupdates-deploymentstate) type.

## Create a deployment with content and an audience

Because content and audience are key to the definition of a deployment, you're required to assign both at the time of creation. While content and audience assignments can't be changed later, device membership within an audience can.

To learn more about creating a deployment, see [Deploy a feature update](/graph/windowsupdates-deploy-update), [Deploy an expedited security update](/graph/windowsupdates-deploy-expedited-update), and [Manage driver update](/graph/windowsupdates-manage-driver-update).

## Configure settings

### Schedule

[Schedule settings](/graph/api/resources/windowsupdates-schedulesettings) govern how the content is deployed over time to devices in the deployment audience. You can configure schedule settings for deployments of feature updates.

To learn more about schedule settings, see [Schedule a deployment](windowsupdates-schedule-deployment.md).

### Monitoring

You can use [monitoring settings](/graph/api/resources/windowsupdates-monitoringsettings) to configure alerts and automated actions to take based on update signals from devices. Monitoring settings can be configured for deployments of feature updates.

To learn more about monitoring settings, see [Manage monitoring rules](windowsupdates-manage-monitoring-rules.md).

### User experience

For deployments of expedited quality updates, [user experience settings](/graph/api/resources/windowsupdates-userexperiencesettings) temporarily override existing policies on the device for update experience.

To learn more about user experience settings, see [Deploy an expedited security update](windowsupdates-deploy-expedited-update.md).

## Get or set lifecycle state

### States

Deployments move through lifecycle states as described in the following table.

| State       | Description                                                                                       |
|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `scheduled` | The deployment is waiting for offer conditions to be met to start offering the update to devices. |
| `offering`  | The deployment is offering the update to devices.                                                 |
| `paused`    | The deployment is paused and prevented from offering the update to devices until it's unpaused.  |
| `faulted`   | The deployment isn't offering the update to devices due to a reason Windows Autopatch can't resolve.  |


### Transitions

| Transition                           | Condition                                |
|--------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| `scheduled` → `offering`             | Scheduling condition is met.             |
| `offering` → `scheduled`             | Scheduling condition isn't met.         |
| `scheduled` or `offering` → `paused` | There's a request or automatic action to pause. |
| `paused` → `scheduled` or `offering` | There's no longer a request or automatic action to pause. |
| `offering`, `scheduled`, or `paused` → `faulted` | There's an error that Windows Autopatch can't resolve. |

### Resource model

The [deployment](/graph/api/resources/windowsupdates-deployment) resource has a **state** property of type [deploymentState](/graph/api/resources/windowsupdates-deploymentstate) which provides information about the current lifecycle state.

The effective **value** of the deployment state is determined as a net result of several inputs and asynchronous processes, but you can request a particular value by setting **requestedValue** as one of these inputs. Other inputs to the effective deployment state value include schedule settings and monitoring settings.

## Assign a device to multiple deployments

You can assign a device to multiple deployments at one time. These deployments can be for content of the same update category (for example all deployments are feature updates), or for content of different update categories.

When you assign a device to two deployments for content of different update categories (for example, a feature update and an expedited quality update), the content is offered in a sequence based on the recommendation from Microsoft.

When you assign a device to two deployments for content of the same update category (for example, feature update versions 20H1 and 20H2, or quality updates from March 2021 and April 2021, or driver version 1.0.0.0 published in January 2023 and 1.0.0.1 published in February 2023), the content ranked higher by Microsoft is offered. For feature updates and quality updates, more recent updates are higher ranked. For driver updates, applicable updates are typically ranked by version and publication date.  This behavior does not apply if one of the deployments is still scheduled for the device and isn't ready to offer content. In that case, the other deployment delivers content to the device.
