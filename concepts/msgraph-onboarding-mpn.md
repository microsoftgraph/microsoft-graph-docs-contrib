Use the following steps to join Microsoft Partner Network:

3. To verify your identity, set your phone number and select **Text me** or **Call me** to get the verification code. When you receive the code, input it and choose **Next**.

4. Select **Yes** to specify that your email address was provided by your company.

5. Complete you account information, set a password, and confirm the verification code sent to your email, and then choose **Next**.
