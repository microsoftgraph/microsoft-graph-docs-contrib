## Why use the reports API?

### Integrate Microsoft 365 usage reporting into your organization's existing reporting solution
Many companies have existing reporting solutions that use a reporting application or web portal. You can use the reports API to incorporate Microsoft 365 usage data into your organization's existing reporting solution so that all IT service reports are in a unified location.

### Retain usage reports for historical analysis
You can use the reports API to get the data that's available in all usage reports, including organization-level summaries per service, entity-level (user, sites, accounts) usage information for the last 7/30/90/180 days, and daily activity aggregates. This gives you the option to keep historical usage information for as long as required.

## What data can I access by using the reports API?

You can use the reports API to access the data sets listed in the following table.
