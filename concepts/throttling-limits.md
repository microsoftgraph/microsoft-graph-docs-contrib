#Customer intent: As a developer using Microsoft Graph to access multiple services, I want to understand the throttling limits imposed by each service, so that I can ensure my application stays within the allowed limits and avoids being throttled.

# Microsoft Graph service-specific throttling limits

Microsoft Graph concurrently imposes two categories of throttling limits for all API calls: 
- Global limits that apply to all services
- Service-specific limits that apply to individual services

Any request can be evaluated against multiple limits, depending on the scope of the limit (per app across all tenants, per tenant for all apps, per app per tenant, and so on), the request type (GET, POST, PATCH, and so on), and other factors. The first limit to be reached triggers throttling behavior.

The following table indicates the global limits:

| Request type | Per app across all tenants      |
|--------------|---------------------------------|
| Any          | 130,000 requests per 10 seconds |

The rest of this article provides an overview of the service-specific throttling limits for each Microsoft Graph service.

> [!NOTE]
> The specific limits described in this article are subject to change.
>
> In this section, the term *tenant* refers to the Microsoft 365 organization where the application is installed. For a single-tenant application, this tenant can be the same as the one where the application was created; for a multitenant application, it can be a different tenant.
