# Manage multiple customer tenants using the Microsoft 365 Lighthouse API

Microsoft 365 Lighthouse is an admin portal that lets Managed Service Providers (MSPs) remotely manage multiple customer tenants. It helps MSPs secure and manage devices, data, and users at scale for small- and medium-sized business (SMB) customers who are using Microsoft 365 Business Premium.

Microsoft 365 Lighthouse helps MSPs simplify onboarding of Microsoft 365 Business Premium customer tenants. It offers an MSP the convenience of multi-tenant views across all its customer tenant environments. It can recommend security configuration baselines tailored to the MSP's SMB customers. With Microsoft 365 Lighthouse, MSPs can scale the management of their customer tenants, focus on what's most important, quickly find and investigate risks, and take action to help get their customer tenants to a healthy and secure state.

> [!NOTE]  
> This documentation is about the Microsoft 365 Lighthouse API available in _Microsoft Graph_. A similar offering, Azure Lighthouse, helps service providers deliver managed services for Azure services by using comprehensive and robust management tooling built into the _Azure_ platform. To learn more, see [What is Azure Lighthouse](/azure/lighthouse/overview).
