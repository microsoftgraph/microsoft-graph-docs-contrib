# Get started with Microsoft Graph in a Swift iOS App

> **Building apps for enterprise customers?** Your app may not work if your enterprise customer turns on enterprise mobility security features like <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/active-directory-conditional-access-device-policies/" target="_newtab">conditional device access</a>. In this case, you may not know and your customers may experience errors. 

> To support **all enterprise customers** across **all enterprise scenarios**, you must use the Azure AD endpoint and manage your apps using the [Azure portal](https://aka.ms/aadapplist). For more information, see [Deciding between the Azure AD and Azure AD v2.0 endpoints](../concepts/auth_overview.md#deciding-between-the-azure-ad-and-azure-ad-v20-endpoints).

This article describes the tasks required to get an access token from the [Azure AD v2.0 endpoint](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/docs/concepts/converged_auth) and call Microsoft Graph. It walks you through the code inside the [Office 365 Connect Sample for iOS (SDK)](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/ios-swift-connect-sample) to explain the main concepts that you have to implement in an app that uses Microsoft Graph. It describes how to access Microsoft Graph by using the [Microsoft Graph SDK for iOS](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/msgraph-sdk-ios).

You can download the version of the app that you'll create from this GitHub repo:

* [Office 365 Connect Sample for iOS Using the Microsoft Graph SDK](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/ios-swift-connect-sample)

The following image shows the app you'll create.

![Connect sample walkthrough, shows connecting and sending a mail in the app](./images/iOSConnectWalkthrough.png)


The workflow will be to connect/authenticate to Microsoft Graph, sign in with your work or personal account, and finally send a mail to a recipient.

**Don't feel like building an app?** Use the [Microsoft Graph quick start](https://graph.microsoft.io/en-us/getting-started) to get up and running fast.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you'll need: 

* [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/downloads/) from Apple
* Installation of [CocoaPods](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/using-cocoapods.html) as a dependency manager
* A [Microsoft account](https://www.outlook.com/) or a [work or school account](http://dev.office.com/devprogram)
* The [Microsoft Graph Starter Project for iOS](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/ios-objectivec-connect-sample). This template contains classes that you'll add code to. To get this project, clone or download the sample project from this location, and you'll work with the workspace inside the **starter-project** folder (**ios-objectivec-connect-sample.xcworkspace**).

## Register the app
 
1. Sign into the [App Registration Portal](https://apps.dev.microsoft.com/) using either your personal or work or school account.
2. Select **Add an app**.
3. Enter a name for the app, and select **Create application**.
	
	The registration page displays, listing the properties of your app.
 
4. Under **Platforms**, select **Add platform**.
5. Select **Native platform**.
6. Copy the Client Id to the clipboard. You'll need to enter this value into the sample app.

	The app id is a unique identifier for your app. 

7. Select **Save**.

## Importing the project dependencies

1. Clone this repository, [Office 365 Connect Sample for iOS Using the Microsoft Graph SDK](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/ios-objectivec-connect-sample). 
>IMPORTANT: Use the sample in the starter-project folder and not the sample at the root of the project.

2. Use CocoaPods to import the Microsoft Graph SDK and authentication dependencies. This sample app already contains a podfile that will get the pods into the project. Navigate to the folder **starter-project** in the **Terminal** app, and from **Terminal** run:

        pod install

   You will receive confirmation that the pods have been imported into the project. For more information, see [CocoaPods](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/using-cocoapods.html)


## Enable keychain sharing
 
For Xcode8, you need to add the keychain group or your app will fail to access keychain. 
To add the keychain group:
 
1. Select the project on the project manager panel in Xcode. (⌘ + 1).
 
2. Select **iOS-ObjectiveC-Connect-Sample**.
 
3. On the Capabilities tab, enable **Keychain Sharing**.
 
4. Add **com.microsoft.ios-objectivec-connect-sample** to the Keychain Groups.

## Authenticating with Microsoft Graph

To revisit the UI workflow, the app is going to have the user authenticate, and then they'll have the ability to send a mail to a specified user. To make requests against the Microsoft Graph service, an authentication provider must be supplied which is capable of authenticating HTTPS requests with an appropriate OAuth 2.0 bearer token. In the sample project there's an authentication structure already stubbed out called **Authentication.swift.** We will add a function to request, and acquire, an access token for calling the Microsoft Graph API. 

1. Open the Xcode project workspace (**Graph-iOS-Swift-Connect.xcworkspace**), and open the structure extension file **Authentication.swift** Find the following code in that extension.


  ```swift
     /**
     Authenticates to Microsoft Graph. 
     If a user has previously signed in before and not disconnected, silent log in
     will take place. 
     If not, authentication will ask for credentials
     */
    func connectToGraph(withClientId clientId: String,
                                     scopes: [String],
                                     completion:@escaping (_ error: MSGraphError?) -> Void) {
    
        // Set client ID
        NXOAuth2AuthenticationProvider.setClientId(clientId, scopes: scopes)
        
        // Try silent log in. This will attempt to sign in if there is a previous successful
        // sign in user information.
        if NXOAuth2AuthenticationProvider.sharedAuth().loginSilent() == true {
            completion(nil)
        }
        // Otherwise, present log in controller.
        else {
            NXOAuth2AuthenticationProvider.sharedAuth()
                .login(with: nil) { (error: Error?) in
                    
                    if let nserror = error {
                        completion(MSGraphError.nsErrorType(error: nserror as NSError))
                    }
                    else {
                        completion(nil)
                    }
            }
        }
    }
  ```


2. We'll call this method from **ConnectViewController.swift**. This controller is the default view that the app loads, and there is a single button named **Connect** that the user will tap that will initiate the authentication process. This method takes in one parameter, the **scopes**, we'll discuss scopes in more detail below. Add the following action to **ConnectViewController.swift**.

  ```swift
  // MARK: Authentication
  private extension ConnectViewController {
    func authenticate() {
        loadingUI(show: true)
        
        let clientId = ApplicationConstants.clientId
        let scopes = ApplicationConstants.scopes
        
        authentication.connectToGraph(withClientId: clientId, scopes: scopes) {
            (error) in
            
            defer {self.loadingUI(show: false)}
            
            if let graphError = error {
                switch graphError {
                case .nsErrorType(let nsError):
                    print(NSLocalizedString("ERROR", comment: ""), nsError.localizedDescription)
                    self.showError(message: NSLocalizedString("CHECK_LOG_ERROR", comment: ""))
                }
            }
            else {
                self.performSegue(withIdentifier: "showSendMail", sender: nil)
            }
        }
    }
  }

  ```

## Send an email with Microsoft Graph

After configuring the project to be able to authenticate, the next tasks are getting the authenticated user's email address, display name, and profile photo. After the sample gets these values it uploads the profile picture to OneDrive and gets the sharing Url of the picture. Finally, it sends a mail to a user using the Microsoft Graph API. 

By default the logged in user will be the recipient, but you have the ability to change it to any other recipient. The code we'll work with here is in the class **SendMailViewController.swift.** You'll see that there is other code represented here for the UI, and a helper method to retrieve user profile information from the Microsoft Graph service. We'll concentrate on the methods for creating a mail message and sending that message.

1. Open **SendMailViewController.swift.**  and find the mail body creating helper method in the class:

  ```swift
    /**
     Creates sample email message
     
     - parameter emailAddress: recipient email address
     
     - returns: MSGraphMessage object with given recipient. The body is created from EmailBody.html
     */
    func createSampleMessage(to emailAddress: String, picLink pictureUrl: String) -> MSGraphMessage? {
        let message = MSGraphMessage()
        
        // set recipients
        
        let _ = self.userPicture
        let toRecipient = MSGraphRecipient()
        let msEmailAddress = MSGraphEmailAddress()
        msEmailAddress.address = emailAddress
        toRecipient.emailAddress = msEmailAddress
        let toRecipientList = [toRecipient]
        message.toRecipients = toRecipientList
        message.subject = NSLocalizedString("MAIL_SUBJECT", comment: "")
        let messageBody = MSGraphItemBody()
        messageBody.contentType = MSGraphBodyType.html()
        guard let emailBodyFilePath = Bundle.main.path(forResource: "EmailBody", ofType: "html") else {return nil}
        messageBody.content = try! String(contentsOfFile: emailBodyFilePath, encoding: String.Encoding.utf8)
        messageBody.content = messageBody.content.replacingOccurrences(of: "a href=%s", with: ("a href=" + pictureUrl))
        message.body = messageBody

        if let unwrappedImage = self.userPicture {
            let fileAttachment = MSGraphFileAttachment()
            let data = UIImageJPEGRepresentation(unwrappedImage, 1.0)
            fileAttachment.contentType = "image/png"
            fileAttachment.oDataType = "#microsoft.graph.fileAttachment"
            fileAttachment.contentBytes = data?.base64EncodedString()
            fileAttachment.name = "me.png"
            message.attachments.append(fileAttachment)
        }
        return message
    }

  ```
2. find the following helper methods for getting user information, getting a profile photograph, and uploading the photograph to OneDrive:

  ```swift
      /**
     Fetches user information such as mail and display name
     */
    func getUserInfo() {
        self.sendButton.isEnabled = false
        self.statusTextView.text = NSLocalizedString("LOADING_USER_INFO", comment: "")
        
        self.graphClient.me().request().getWithCompletion {
            (user: MSGraphUser?, error: Error?) in
            if let graphError = error {
                print(NSLocalizedString("ERROR", comment: ""), graphError)
                DispatchQueue.main.async(execute: {
                    self.statusTextView.text = NSLocalizedString("GRAPH_ERROR", comment: "")
                })
            }
            else {
                guard let userInfo = user else {
                    DispatchQueue.main.async(execute: {
                        self.statusTextView.text = NSLocalizedString("USER_INFO_LOAD_FAILURE", comment: "")
                    })
                    return
                }
                DispatchQueue.main.async(execute: {
                    self.emailTextField.text = userInfo.mail
                    
                    if let displayName = userInfo.displayName {
                        self.headerLabel.text = "Hi " + displayName
                    }
                    else {
                        self.headerLabel.text = NSString(format: NSLocalizedString("HI_USER", comment: "") as NSString, "") as String
                    }
                    
                    self.statusTextView.text = NSLocalizedString("USER_INFO_LOAD_SUCCESS", comment: "")
                    self.sendButton.isEnabled = true
                })
            }
        }
    }
    
    /**
     Uploads the user's profile picture (obtained via the Graph API) to the user's OneDrive drive. The OneDrive sharing url is
     returned in the completion handler.
    */
    func uploadPictureToOneDrive(uploadFile image: UIImage?, with completion: @escaping (_ result: GraphResult<String, NSError>) ->Void) {
        
        var webUrl: String = ""
        guard let unwrappedImage = image else {
            return
        }
        let data = UIImageJPEGRepresentation(unwrappedImage, 1.0)
        self.graphClient
            .me()
            .drive()
            .root()
            .children()
            .driveItem("me.png")
            .contentRequest()
            .upload(from: data, completion: {
                (driveItem: MSGraphDriveItem?, error: Error?) in
                if let nsError = error {
                    print(NSLocalizedString("ERROR", comment: ""), nsError.localizedDescription)
                    DispatchQueue.main.async(execute: {
                        self.statusTextView.text = NSLocalizedString("UPLOAD_PICTURE_FAILURE", comment: nsError.localizedDescription)
                    })
                    return

                } else {
                    webUrl = (driveItem?.webUrl)!
                    completion(.success(webUrl))
                }
            })
    }


    /**
     Gets the user's profile picture. Returns the picture as a UIImage via completion handler
    */
    func getUserPicture(forUser upn: String, with completion: @escaping (_ result: GraphResult<UIImage, NSError>) -> Void) {
        
        //Asynchronous Graph call. Closure is invoked after getUserPicture completes. Requires @escaping attribute
        self.graphClient.me().photoValue().download {
            (url: URL?, response: URLResponse?, error: Error?) in
            
                if let nsError = error {
                    print(NSLocalizedString("ERROR", comment: ""), nsError.localizedDescription)
                    DispatchQueue.main.async(execute: {
                        self.statusTextView.text = NSLocalizedString("GET_PICTURE_FAILURE", comment: nsError.localizedDescription)
                    })
                    return
                }
                guard let picUrl = url else {
                    DispatchQueue.main.async(execute: {
                        self.statusTextView.text = NSLocalizedString("GET_PICTURE_FAILURE", comment: "User profile picture is nil")
                    })
                    return
                }
                print(picUrl)
            
                let picData = NSData(contentsOf: picUrl)
                let picImage = UIImage(data: picData! as Data)
            
                if let validPic = picImage {
                    completion(.success(validPic))
                }
                else {
                    DispatchQueue.main.async(execute: {
                        self.statusTextView.text = NSLocalizedString("GET_PICTURE_FAILURE", comment: "Picture data is invalid")
                    })
                }
            }
    }

  ```

3. Find the following send mail method in the class.  

  ```swift
    @IBAction func sendMail(_ sender: AnyObject) {
        guard let toEmail = self.emailTextField.text else {return}
        guard let picUrl = self.userPictureUrl else {return}
        if let message = self.createSampleMessage(to: toEmail, picLink: picUrl) {
            
            let requestBuilder = graphClient.me().sendMail(with: message, saveToSentItems: false)
            let mailRequest = requestBuilder?.request()
            
            _ = mailRequest?.execute(completion: {
                (response: [AnyHashable: Any]?, error: Error?) in
                if let nsError = error {
                    print(NSLocalizedString("ERROR", comment: ""), nsError.localizedDescription)
                    DispatchQueue.main.async(execute: {
                        self.statusTextView.text = NSLocalizedString("SEND_FAILURE", comment: "")
                    })
                }
                else {
                    DispatchQueue.main.async(execute: {
                        self.descriptionLabel.text = "Check your inbox. You have a new message :)"
                        self.statusTextView.text = NSLocalizedString("SEND_SUCCESS", comment: "")
                    })
                }
            })
        }
    }

  ```


## Run the app
1. Before running the sample you'll need to supply the client ID you received from the registration process in the section **Register the app.** Open **ApplicationConstants.swift** . You'll see that the ClientID from the registration process can be added to the top of the file.:  

  ```swift
struct ApplicationConstants {
    static let clientId = "Enter_Client_Id_Here"
    static let scopes   = ["openid", "profile", "Mail.ReadWrite","mail.send","Files.ReadWrite","User.ReadBasic.All"]
}


  ```

> Note: You'll notice that the following permission scopes have been configured for this project: **"https://graph.microsoft.com/Mail.Send", "https://graph.microsoft.com/User.Read", "offline_access"**. The service calls used in this project, sending a mail to your mail account and retrieving some profile information (Display Name, Email Address) require these permissions for the app to run properly.

2. Run the sample, tap **Connect,** sign in with your personal or work or school account, and grant the requested permissions.

3. Choose the **Send email** button. When the mail is sent, a success message is displayed below the button.
