# Microsoft Graph throttling guidance

Throttling limits the number of concurrent calls to a service to prevent overuse of resources. Microsoft Graph is designed to handle a high volume of requests. If an overwhelming number of requests occurs, throttling helps maintain optimal performance and reliability of the Microsoft Graph service.

Throttling limits vary based on the scenario. For example, if you are performing a large volume of writes, the possibility for throttling is higher than if you are only performing reads.

## What happens when throttling occurs?
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD026 -->

When a throttling threshold is exceeded, Microsoft Graph limits any further requests from that client for a period of time. When throttling occurs, Microsoft Graph returns HTTP status code 429 (Too many requests), and the requests fail. A suggested wait time is returned in the response header of the failed request. Throttling behavior can depend on the type and number of requests. For example, if you have a high volume of requests, all requests types are throttled. Threshold limits vary based on the request type. Therefore, you could encounter a scenario where writes are throttled but reads are still permitted.

## Common throttling scenarios

The most common causes of throttling of clients include:

- A large number of requests across all applications in a tenant.
- A large number of requests from a particular application across all tenants.

## Best practices to handle throttling

The following are best practices for handling throttling:

- Reduce the number of operations per request.
- Reduce the frequency of calls.
- Avoid immediate retries, because all requests accrue against your usage limits.

When you implement error handling, use the HTTP error code 429 to detect throttling. The failed response includes the `Retry-After` response header. Backing off requests using the `Retry-After` delay is the fastest way to recover from throttling because Microsoft Graph continues to log resource usage while a client is being throttled.

1. Wait the number of seconds specified in the `Retry-After` header.
2. Retry the request.
3. If the request fails again with a 429 error code, you are still being throttled. Continue to use the recommended `Retry-After` delay and retry the request until it succeeds.

The following resources currently provide a `Retry-After` header:

- [User](/graph/api/resources/user?view=graph-rest-1.0)
- [Photo](/graph/api/resources/profilephoto?view=graph-rest-1.0)
- [Mail](/graph/api/resources/message?view=graph-rest-1.0)
- [Calendar (users and groups)](/graph/api/resources/event?view=graph-rest-1.0)
- [Contact](/graph/api/resources/contact?view=graph-rest-1.0)
- [Attachment](/graph/api/resources/attachment?view=graph-rest-1.0)
- [Group conversations](/graph/api/resources/conversation?view=graph-rest-1.0)
- [People and social](/graph/api/resources/social-overview?view=graph-rest-beta)
- [Drive (OneDrive)](/graph/api/resources/drive?view=graph-rest-1.0)
- [External item (Microsoft Search)](/graph/api/resources/externalitem?view=graph-rest-beta)
- [Report](/graph/api/resources/report)
- [Subscription](/graph/api/resources/subscription)
- [Trending](/graph/api/resources/insights-trending)
- [Used insight](/graph/api/resources/insights-used)
- [Shared insight](/graph/api/resources/insights-shared)
- [User settings](/graph/api/resources/usersettings)
- [Invitation](/graph/api/resources/invitation)

For a broader discussion of throttling on the Microsoft Cloud, see [Throttling Pattern](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/patterns/throttling).

> [!NOTE]
> If no `Retry-After` header is provided by the response, we recommend implementing an exponential backoff retry policy. You can also implement [more advanced patterns](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/patterns/category/resiliency) when building large-scale applications.
>
> Microsoft Graph SDKs already implement handlers that rely on the `Retry-After` header or default to an exponential backoff retry policy.

## Best practices to avoid throttling

Programming patterns like continuously polling a resource to check for updates and regularly scanning resource collections to check for new or deleted resources are more likely to lead to applications being throttled and degrade overall performances. You should instead leverage [change tracking](delta-query-overview.md) and [change notifications](webhooks.md) when available.

>[!NOTE]
>[Best practices for discovering files and detecting changes at scale](https://docs.microsoft.com/onedrive/developer/rest-api/concepts/scan-guidance?view=odsp-graph-online) describes best practices in details.

## Service-specific limits

Microsoft Graph allows you to access data in [multiple services](overview-major-services.md), such as Outlook or Azure Active Directory. These services impose their own throttling limits that affect applications that use Microsoft Graph to access them.

> [!NOTE]
> The specific limits described here are subject to change.

> **Note:** In this section, the term *tenant* refers to the Microsoft 365 organization where the application is installed. This tenant can be the same as the the one where the application was created, in the case of a single tenant application, or it can be different, in the case of a [multi-tenant application](/azure/active-directory/develop/setup-multi-tenant-app).

### Outlook service limits

Outlook service limits are evaluated for each app ID and mailbox combination. In other words, the limits described apply to a specific app accessing a specific mailbox (user or group). If an application exceeds the limit in one mailbox, it does not affect the ability to access another mailbox. The following limits apply to the public cloud as well as [national cloud deployments](/graph/deployments).

| Limit                                                      | Applies to      |
|------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| 10,000 API requests in a 10 minute period                  | v1.0 and beta endpoints |
| 4 concurrent requests                                      | v1.0 and beta endpoints   |
| 15 megabytes (MB) upload (PATCH, POST, PUT) in a 30 second period | v1.0 and beta endpoints   |

See also [Microsoft Teams limits](/graph/api/resources/teams-api-overview#microsoft-teams-limits) 
and [polling requirements](/graph/api/resources/teams-api-overview#polling-requirements).

### Insights service limits

The following limits apply to any request on `me/insights` or `users/{id}/insights`.

| Limit                                                      | Applies to      |
|------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| 10,000 API requests in a 10 minute period                  | v1.0 and beta endpoints |
| 4 concurrent requests                                      | v1.0 and beta endpoints   |

### Microsoft Graph reports service limits

The following limits apply to any request on `/reports`.

| Operation                 | Limit per app per tenant     | Limit per tenant           |
|---------------------------|------------------------------|----------------------------|
| Any request (CSV)         | 14 requests per 10 minutes   | 40 requests per 10 minutes |
| Any request (JSON, beta)  | 100 requests per 10 minutes  | n/a                        |

The preceding limits apply individually to each report API. For example a request to Microsoft Teams user activity report API and a request to Outlook user activity report API within 10 minutes will count as 1 request out of 14 for each API, not 2 requests out of 14 for both.

### Invitation manager service limits

The following limits apply to any request on `/invitations`.

| Operation                 | Limit per tenant             |
|---------------------------|------------------------------|
| Any operation             | 150 requests per 5 seconds   |
