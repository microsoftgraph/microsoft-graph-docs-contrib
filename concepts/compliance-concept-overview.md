# Overview of compliance and privacy APIs in Microsoft Graph

The Microsoft Graph APIs for compliance and privacy provide functionality for organizations to automate repetitive tasks and integrate with their existing compliance tools to build predictable workflows that are often required to meet industry regulations.

The compliance and privacy APIs are intended to help deliver on the vision of helping organizations adapt and extend Microsoft 365 Compliance to their own specific requirements, enable integration for existing custom or third-party solutions, and accelerate and support the use of Microsoft 365 solutions across the enterprise digital estate.

## Electronic discovery (eDiscovery) (preview)

### Develop applications that ensure a repeatable, predictable, and standard process

Organizations rely on [Microsoft 365 eDiscovery](/microsoft-365/compliance/ediscovery?view=o365-worldwide&preserve-view=true) capabilities to meet requirements to find the truth about what happened in their organization when they need to, based on internal or external requirements such as litigation, investigation, or regulatory compliance.

In many organizations, eDiscovery workflows are frequent, critical, and high volume. In the cases where there are common repeated tasks or a high volume of activities, the APIs will help provide a scalable way to repeat processes consistently and effectively.

### Manage your eDiscovery workflows

Many organizations handle a high volume of cases and eDiscovery requests and would prefer to automate some tasks. The  Microsoft Graph APIs for advanced eDiscovery provide API access to most functions available within the advanced eDiscovery solution.

Depending on the current systems and processes in place, organizations might have various priorities for automation and integration, from upstream processes such as case creation, to downstream such as collection, review set queries, or export. Supporting workflows with APIs throughout the advanced eDiscovery workflow provides flexibility and options.

### Build custom eDiscovery workflows with Microsoft Graph

- Automate case management and synchronization with case management tools.

- Add standardized tagging pallets to cases.

- Create custom reporting to track case load and progress from individual cases.

## Privacy management by subject rights requests

In accordance with certain privacy regulations around the world, individuals can make requests to review or manage the personal data about themselves that companies have collected. These requests are referred to as subject rights requests within the Microsoft 365 privacy management solution; they are sometimes also referred to as data subject requests (DSRs) or data subject access requests (DSARs). [Microsoft 365 privacy management](/privacy/solutions/privacymanagement/privacy-management?view=o365-worldwide&preserve-view=true) empowers personnel responsible for fulfilling subject rights requests to easily identify data subjects and find their personal information among an organization’s data in Exchange, SharePoint, OneDrive, and Teams. 

The Microsoft Graph APIs for subject rights request provide functionality for organizations to automate repetitive tasks and integrate with existing data subject request tools, to enable building repeatable workflows that can be incorporated to their business processes. You can use the subject rights request APIs to help you automate and scale your organization's ability to perform subject rights requests searches in Microsoft 365 and help meet industry regulations more efficiently.

## Records management (preview)

Organizations of all types require a records-management solution to manage critical records across their corporate data. [Microsoft Purview records management](/microsoft-365/compliance/records-management) helps an organization manage their legal obligations, provides the ability to demonstrate compliance with regulations, and increases efficiency with regular disposition of items that are no longer required.

The records management solution is used by organizations in large volumes to protect, label, retain, or delete their data. The Microsoft Graph APIs for records management allow organizations to manage labels and label-associated functionalities more efficiently, automate the repetitive tasks, and equip customers with flexible options.
