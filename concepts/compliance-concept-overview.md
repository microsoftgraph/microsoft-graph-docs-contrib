# Overview of Compliance in Microsoft Graph

The Microsoft Graph APIs for compliance provide functionality for organizations to automate repetitive tasks and integrate with their existing compliance tools to build predictable workflows that are often required to meet industry regulations.

The compliance APIs are intended to help deliver on the vision of helping organizations adapt and extend Microsoft 365 Compliance to their own specific requirements, enable integration for existing custom or third-party solutions, and accelerate and support the use of Microsoft 365 solutions across the enterprise digital estate.

## Develop applications that ensure a repeatable, predictable, and standard process

Organizations rely on Microsoft 365 eDiscovery capabilities to meet requirements to find the truth about what happened in their organization when they need to, based on internal or external requirements such as litigation, investigation, or regulatory compliance.

In many organizations, eDiscovery workflows are frequent, critical, and high volume. In the cases where there are common repeated tasks or a high volume of activities, the APIs will help provide a scalable way to repeat processes consistently and effectively.

## Manage your eDiscovery workflows

Many organizations handle a high volume of cases and eDiscovery requests and would prefer to automate some tasks. The  Microsoft Graph APIs for advanced eDiscovery provide API access to most functions available within the advanced eDiscovery solution.

Depending on the current systems and processes in place, organizations might have various priorities for automation and integration, from upstream processes such as case creation, to downstream such as collection, review set queries, or export. Supporting workflows with APIs throughout the advanced eDiscovery workflow provides flexibility and options.
