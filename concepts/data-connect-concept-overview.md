# Overview of Microsoft Graph Data Connect

In a hybrid workplace, organizations must develop a data-driven culture in order to dynamically evolve. Today's organizations have an incredible amount of business data across applications and services in Microsoft 365.
 
The potential this data holds is powerful; however, to remain competitive, organizations must unlock access to their Microsoft 365 data and streamline their manual analytical processes. Data is an organization's competitive advantage. 

You can use [Microsoft Graph Data Connect](https://developer.microsoft.com/graph) to access your Microsoft 365 data for enterprise analytics. Data Connect provides secure, scalable access to relevant Microsoft 365 datasets in Microsoft Fabric, Azure Synapse, and Azure Data Factory. 

Data Connect unlocks a number of enterprise analytics scenarios, including: 

- **Customer relationship analytics** - For commercial business leaders, go beyond traditional customer relationship management (CRM) insights and understand customer interactions and relationships based on communication and collaboration patterns.
- **Business process analytics** - For better operations, see how work really flows through the organization on a day-to-day basis. Pinpoint manual processes and workflow bottlenecks that can be automated or optimized.
- **Security and compliance analytics** - To secure sensitive data, learn how employees use and share sensitive information. Implement anomaly detection, threat intelligence, audit log analysis, risk management, and legal forensics.
- **People productivity analytics** - To drive transformation, export your [Microsoft Viva](/viva/microsoft-viva-overview) productivity metrics, so you can convert insights into solutions with digital adoption, smart meetings and content, hybrid workplaces, and cultural change.

## Breadth and depth of Microsoft 365 data

Organizations can access various types of Microsoft 365 data via Microsoft Graph Data Connect. Datasets are available from a wide variety of Microsoft 365 sources, including Azure Active Directory, Outlook, Teams, SharePoint, Viva Insights, and Microsoft groups — and the list is growing. 

![An image that shows various types of Microsoft 365 data that organizations get though Microsoft Graph Data Connect.](images/data-connect-continuing-growth.png)

Microsoft 365 datasets come ready for analysis and include the following categories:  

- **Basic datasets:** Datasets generated from raw customer-created content and inputs from Microsoft 365 applications and services. 
- **Cleaned datasets:** Datasets generated by either normalization and de-duplication from basic datasets. This can also include datasets created from user activity or behavior signals in Microsoft 365.
- **Curated datasets:** Datasets custom-generated for a specific use case or analytics scenario. This category can also include datasets from other Microsoft organizations (Viva Insights, SharePoint, and so on) on Microsoft 365 analytics application for their extensibility.

For a list of Data Connect datasets, see [Datasets, regions, and sinks supported by Microsoft Graph Data Connect](/graph/data-connect-datasets).

### Who gets value from Microsoft Graph Data Connect?

- **LOB business leaders** need actionable insights from Microsoft 365 data because it helps them make informed decisions regarding their organization. By analyzing data, they can identify patterns and trends, including customer relationship analytics, business process analytics, security and compliance analytics, and people productivity analytics.
- **Data engineers** collect, process, and transform Microsoft 365 data from Data Connect into a format that data scientists and analysts can use. They construct and manage Microsoft 365 data pipelines as data combined across other data sources in Microsoft Fabric and ensure the highest levels of data quality and consistency. 
- **Data scientists** and **data analysts** play a critical role in helping business leaders make sense of their data and use it to drive business decisions. Data analysts identify trends, patterns, and insights. They analyze Microsoft 365 data and create reports, dashboards, and visualizations to communicate findings and make informed decisions. Data scientists build accurate, predictive models and algorithms based on the petabytes of Microsoft 365 data available from Data Connect. They use machine learning to analyze data and make predictions about future outcomes.
