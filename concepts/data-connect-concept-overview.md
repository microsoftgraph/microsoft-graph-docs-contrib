# Overview of Microsoft Graph Data Connect

In a hybrid workplace, organizations must develop a data-driven culture to evolve dynamically. Today's organizations have an incredible amount of business data across applications and services in Microsoft 365.

The potential this data holds is powerful; however, to remain competitive, organizations must unlock access to their Microsoft 365 data and streamline their manual analytical processes. Data is an organization's competitive advantage.

You can use [Microsoft Graph Data Connect](https://developer.microsoft.com/graph/data-connect) to access your Microsoft 365 data for enterprise analytics. Data Connect provides secure, scalable access to relevant Microsoft 365 datasets in Microsoft Fabric, Azure Synapse, and Azure Data Factory.

Data Connect unlocks several enterprise analytics scenarios, including:

- **Customer relationship analytics** - For commercial business leaders, go beyond traditional customer relationship management (CRM) insights and understand customer interactions and relationships based on communication and collaboration patterns. Customer relationship scenarios include customer relationship mesh, customer 360, customer complaint management, and conversation lineage.
- **Business process analytics** - For better operations, see how work flows through the organization on a day-to-day basis. Pinpoint manual processes and workflow bottlenecks that can be automated or optimized. Business process scenarios include process discovery and automation, skills finder and talent alignment, and supply chain automation.
- **Security and compliance analytics** - To secure sensitive data, learn how employees use and share sensitive information. Implement anomaly detection, threat intelligence, audit log analysis, risk management, and legal forensics. Security and compliance scenarios include information sharing, fraud detection, and international threat detection.
- **People productivity analytics** - To drive transformation, export your [Microsoft Viva](/viva/microsoft-viva-overview) productivity metrics, so you can convert insights into solutions with digital adoption, smart meetings and content, hybrid workplaces, and cultural change. People productivity scenarios include culture-driven digital transformation, employee engagement and activity, hybrid work effectiveness, and organizational network analysis.
