> [!TIP]
> For validation and debugging purposes *only*, you can decode app-only access tokens using Microsoft's online token parser at [https://jwt.ms](https://jwt.ms). Parsing your token can be useful if you encounter token errors when calling Microsoft Graph. For example, verifying that the `role` claim in the token contains the expected Microsoft Graph permission scopes.
