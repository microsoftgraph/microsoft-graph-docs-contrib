# Use the Microsoft Search API to search calendar events

Use the Microsoft Search API to search for events in the signed-in user’s primary calendar. The user identity for the search is based on the auth token.

[!INCLUDE [search-schema-updated](../includes/search-schema-updated.md)]

## Example

### Request

This example searches in the user's calendar for the keyword "contoso", and will return up to 25 results.

```HTTP
POST https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/search/query
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "requests": [
    {
      "entityTypes": [
        "event"

        "queryString":"contoso"
      },
      "from": 0,
      "size": 25
    }
  ]
}
```

}
```

## Known limitations

- You can access only the signed-in user’s own mailbox. Searching delegated mailboxes is not supported.
- For events, the **total** property of the [searchHitsContainer](/graph/api/resources/searchhitscontainer) type contains the number of results on the page, not the total number of matching results.
- Sorting results is not supported for events. A sort clause in the request will return a Bad Request error code in the response.
