# Get change notifications for membership changes in teams using Microsoft Graph

Change notifications enable you to subscribe to membership changes (create, update, and delete) in a [team](/graph/api/resources/team). You can get notified whenever a member is added, removed, or updated in a team. You can also get the resource data in the notifications and therefore avoid calling the API to get the payload.

Continue with this article about scenarios for the [conversationMember](/graph/api/resources/conversationmember) resource in the **team** context. Or, find out about [change notifications for other Microsoft Teams resources](teams-change-notification-in-microsoft-teams-overview.md).

> [!NOTE]
> If you request a subscription **expirationDateTime** that is more than one hour in the future, you must subscribe to lifecycle notifications by including a **lifecycleNotificationUrl** property in your subscription request. Otherwise, your subscription request fails with the following error message: `lifecycleNotificationUrl is a required property for subscription creation on this resource when the expirationDateTime value is set to greater than 1 hour`.

## Subscribe to changes in membership of a particular team

To get change notifications for membership changes in a particular team, subscribe to `/teams/{team-id}/members`. This resource supports [including resource data](change-notifications-with-resource-data.md) in the notification.

### Permissions

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) | TeamMember.Read.All, TeamMember.ReadWrite.All |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported.    |
|Application | TeamMember.Read.Group*, TeamMember.Read.All, TeamMember.ReadWrite.All   |

>**Note:** Permissions marked with * are supported as part of [resource-specific consent](/microsoftteams/platform/graph-api/rsc/resource-specific-consent).

### Example

```http
POST https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/subscriptions
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "changeType": "created,deleted,updated",
  "notificationUrl": "https://webhook.azurewebsites.net/api/resourceNotifications",
  "resource": "/teams/{team-id}/members",
  "includeResourceData": true,
  "encryptionCertificate": "{base64encodedCertificate}",
  "encryptionCertificateId": "{customId}",
  "expirationDateTime": "2019-09-19T11:00:00.0000000Z",
  "clientState": "{secretClientState}"
}
```

## Subscribe to membership changes in all teams across the tenant

To get change notifications for membership changes in all teams across the tenant, subscribe to `/teams/getAllMembers`. This resource supports [including resource data](change-notifications-with-resource-data.md) in the notification.

### Permissions

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) | Not supported. |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported.    |
|Application | TeamMember.Read.All, TeamMember.ReadWrite.All   |

### Example

```http
POST https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/subscriptions
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "changeType": "created,deleted,updated",
  "notificationUrl": "https://webhook.azurewebsites.net/api/resourceNotifications",
  "resource": "/teams/getAllMembers",
  "includeResourceData": true,
  "encryptionCertificate": "{base64encodedCertificate}",
  "encryptionCertificateId": "{customId}",
  "expirationDateTime": "2022-08-10T11:00:00.0000000Z",
  "clientState": "{secretClientState}"
}
```

### Notifications with resource data

For notifications with resource data, the payload looks like the following. This payload is used to add a member to a team.

```json
{
    "value": [{
        "subscriptionId": "10493aa0-4d29-4df5-bc0c-ef742cc6cd7f",
        "changeType": "created",
        "clientState": "<<--SpecifiedClientState-->>",
        "subscriptionExpirationDateTime": "2021-02-02T10:30:34.9097561-08:00",
        "resource": "teams('ee0f5ae2-8bc6-4ae5-8466-7daeebbfa062')/members('ZWUwZjVhZTItOGJjNi00YWU1LTg0NjYtN2RhZWViYmZhMDYyIyM3Mzc2MWYwNi0yYWM5LTQ2OWMtOWYxMC0yNzlhOGNjMjY3Zjk=')",
        "resourceData": {
            "id": "ZWUwZjVhZTItOGJjNi00YWU1LTg0NjYtN2RhZWViYmZhMDYyIyM3Mzc2MWYwNi0yYWM5LTQ2OWMtOWYxMC0yNzlhOGNjMjY3Zjk=",
            "@odata.type": "#Microsoft.Graph.aadUserConversationMember",
            "@odata.id": "teams('ee0f5ae2-8bc6-4ae5-8466-7daeebbfa062')/members('ZWUwZjVhZTItOGJjNi00YWU1LTg0NjYtN2RhZWViYmZhMDYyIyM3Mzc2MWYwNi0yYWM5LTQ2OWMtOWYxMC0yNzlhOGNjMjY3Zjk=')"
        },
        "encryptedContent": {
            "data": "<<--EncryptedContent-->",
            "dataKey": "<<--EnryptedDataKeyUsedForEncryptingContent-->>",
            "encryptionCertificateId": "<<--IdOfTheCertificateUsedForEncryptingDataKey-->>",
            "encryptionCertificateThumbprint": "<<--ThumbprintOfTheCertificateUsedForEncryptingDataKey-->>"
        },
        "tenantId": "<<--TenantForWhichNotificationWasSent-->>"
    }],
    "validationTokens": ["<<--ValidationTokens-->>"]
}
```

For details about how to validate tokens and decrypt the payload, see [Set up change notifications that include resource data](change-notifications-with-resource-data.md).

The decrypted notification payload looks like the following. The payload conforms to the [aadUserConversationMember](/graph/api/resources/aaduserconversationmember?preserve-view=true) schema. The payload is similar to that returned by GET operations.

```json
{
  "id": "/ZWUwZjVhZTItOGJjNi00YWU1LTg0NjYtN2RhZWViYmZhMDYyIyM3Mzc2MWYwNi0yYWM5LTQ2OWMtOWYxMC0yNzlhOGNjMjY3Zjk=",
  "roles": [
    "owner"
  ],
  "displayName": "John Doe",
  "userId": "8b081ef6-4792-4def-b2c9-c363a1bf41d5",
  "email": null,
  "tenantId": "10eda0c8-cb50-4390-8751-488c29218b02"
}
```

### Notifications without resource data

Notifications without resource data give you enough information to make GET calls to get the membership content. Subscriptions for notifications without resource data don't require an encryption certificate (because Microsoft Graph doesn't send the actual resource data).

For notifications without resource data, the payload looks like the following. This payload is for a membership change in a team.

```json
{
  "subscriptionId": "9f9d1ed0-c9cc-42e7-8d80-a7fc4b0cda3c",
  "changeType": "created",
  "tenantId": "<<--TenantForWhichNotificationWasSent-->>",
  "clientState": "<<--SpecifiedClientState-->>",
  "subscriptionExpirationDateTime": "2021-02-02T11:26:41.0537895-08:00",
  "resource": "teams('ee0f5ae2-8bc6-4ae5-8466-7daeebbfa062')/members('ZWUwZjVhZTItOGJjNi00YWU1LTg0NjYtN2RhZWViYmZhMDYyIyM3Mzc2MWYwNi0yYWM5LTQ2OWMtOWYxMC0yNzlhOGNjMjY3Zjk=')",
  "resourceData": {
    "id": "ZWUwZjVhZTItOGJjNi00YWU1LTg0NjYtN2RhZWViYmZhMDYyIyM3Mzc2MWYwNi0yYWM5LTQ2OWMtOWYxMC0yNzlhOGNjMjY3Zjk",
    "@odata.type": "#Microsoft.Graph.aadUserConversationMember",
    "@odata.id": "teams('ee0f5ae2-8bc6-4ae5-8466-7daeebbfa062')/members('ZWUwZjVhZTItOGJjNi00YWU1LTg0NjYtN2RhZWViYmZhMDYyIyM3Mzc2MWYwNi0yYWM5LTQ2OWMtOWYxMC0yNzlhOGNjMjY3Zjk=')"
  }
}
```
The **resource** and **@odata.id** properties can be used to make calls to Microsoft Graph to get the payload for the team member.
