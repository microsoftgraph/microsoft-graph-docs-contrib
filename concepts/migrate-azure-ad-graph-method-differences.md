# Differences in actions between Azure AD Graph and Microsoft Graph

> This article is part of *Step 1: review API differences* in the [Azure AD Graph app migration planning checklist](migrate-azure-ad-graph-planning-checklist.md) series.

Some Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) Graph actions have changed. If an action is **not** shown in this list, it's already available in the [v1.0 version](/graph/api/overview) of Microsoft Graph, with exactly the same name as in Azure AD Graph.

|Azure AD Graph <br>(v1.6) function or action |Microsoft Graph<br>(resource/method)|Comments|
|---|---|---|
| getAvailableExtensionProperties | beta&nbsp;-&nbsp;_Not available_ <br> v1.0&nbsp;-&nbsp;[directoryObjects/getAvailableExtensionProperties](/graph/api/directoryobject-getavailableextensionproperties) |  |
| getObjectsByObjectId | beta&nbsp;-&nbsp;[directoryObjects/getByIds](/graph/api/directoryobject-getbyids?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) <br> v1.0&nbsp;-&nbsp;[directoryObjects/getByIds](/graph/api/directoryobject-getbyids) | |
| invalidateAllRefreshTokens | beta&nbsp;-&nbsp;[revokeSignInSessions](/graph/api/user-revokesigninsessions?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) <br> v1.0&nbsp;-&nbsp;[revokeSignInSessions](/graph/api/user-revokesigninsessions) | |
| isMemberOf | beta&nbsp;-&nbsp;_Not planned_ <br> v1.0&nbsp;-&nbsp;_Not planned_ | Use [checkMemberGroups](/graph/api/user-checkmembergroups) and [List memberOf](/graph/api/group-list-memberof) instead. |
| restore | beta&nbsp;-&nbsp;[restore&nbsp;(selected directory objects)](/graph/api/directory-deleteditems-restore?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true)<br> v1.0&nbsp;-&nbsp;[restore selected directory objects)](/graph/api/directory-deleteditems-restore) | You can also view supported directory objects such as deleted applications, users, and groups and permanently delete them. |
