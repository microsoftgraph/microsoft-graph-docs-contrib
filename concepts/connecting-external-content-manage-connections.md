# Create, update, and delete connections in the Microsoft Graph

Connections from external services to the Microsoft Search service are represented by the [externalConnection](/graph/api/resources/externalconnection?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) resource in Microsoft Graph.

The Microsoft Graph connectors platform offers a simple way to add your external data into the Microsoft Graph. A connection is a logical container for your external data that an administrator can manage as a single unit.

Once a connection has been created, you can add your content from any external data source such as an on-premises content source or an external SaaS service. You can only view and manage the connections you created or were explicitly [authorized](/graph/api/external-post-connections?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) to manage. A search admin can view and manage all the connections in the tenant from the Modern Admin Center.

You can model a connection anyway you want, but creating one connection for every instance of your connector is the most common model. For example, each time you [set up the Microsoft Windows file share connector](/microsoftsearch/configure-connector), a new connection is created. You can also create a single connection to add all items from your data source. For example, creating a single connection to add all the tickets and incidents across multiple teams from your helpdesk system.

## States and operations

Your connection can exist in one of the following states.

| State             | Description                                                                                                                                               |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Draft**         | An empty connection is provisioned. The data source, schema, or any settings have not been configured yet.                                                |
| **Ready**         | The connection is provisioned with registered schema and is ready for ingestion.                                                                          |
| **Obsolete**      | This occurs when a dependent feature, such as an API, has been deprecated. Deleting the connection is the only valid operation.                           |
| **LimitExceeded** | If you hit the maximum limit of a single connection or the tenant level quota across all connections, you cannot add more items until you exit the state. |

The following table specifies which operations are available in each state.

| Operation         | Draft              | Ready              | Obsolete           | LimitExceeded      |

A connection allows your application to [define a schema](/graph/api/externalconnection-post-schema?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) for items that will be indexed, and provides an endpoint for your service to add, update, or delete items from the index. [Creating a connection](#create-a-connection) is the first step for an application to add items to the search index.

## Create a connection

Before an application can add items to the search index, it must create and configure a connection using the following steps.

- [Create a connection](/graph/api/external-post-connections?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) with a unique ID, display name, and description.
- [Register a schema](/graph/api/externalconnection-post-schema?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) to define the fields that will be included in the index.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> After a schema has been registered, it cannot be changed for an existing connection.

## Update a connection

You can change the display name or description of an existing connection by [updating the connection](/graph/api/externalconnection-update?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true).

## Delete a connection

You can [delete a connection](/graph/api/externalconnection-delete?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true), and remove all items that were indexed via that connection.
