# Work with grading categories

This article describes how to use the education API in Microsoft Graph to set up and work with grading categories.

Teachers use grading categories to apply weights to assignments for student grades. For example, homework might account for 60% of a grade and tests account for 40% of a grade.

Assignments contribute to a grade based on their point values and the weight assigned to the grading category. For example, in a class with two assignments in a grading category that represents 50% of the grade, if the first assignment has 10 points, and the second has 40 points, the assignments contribute 5% and 20% to the total grade.

Grading categories are defined in the settings of a class. Every assignment that contributes to the final average grade must have a grading category applied. The weights of the grading categories for a class must add up to 100 during create, update, or delete operations. 

To work with grading categories in your app, you need to get the ID of the class and the assignment settings for that class. This article walks through the steps to create, add, update, and delete grading categories that are defined in the assignment settings. 

>**Note:** The education API in Microsoft Graph supports delegated (per user) permissions only.

## Get a class

A class is a group of students and teachers who share assignments and feedback. To work with grading categories, you first get the list of classes from your education tenant, then you identify the class for which you want to set grading categories on assignments.

To get a list of the classes in your tenant, see [List classes](/graph/api/educationclass-list).

## Get assignment settings

To add grading categories, you first need to get the assignment settings for the class, and identify which grading category needs to be applied for specific assignments.

To get the assignment settings for a class, see [Get assignment settings](/graph/api/educationassignmentsettings-get).

## Delete grading categories

You can delete a grading category when you no longer need it for your assignment, or if you want to simplify your evaluation process. Deleting a grading category removes it from the assignment settings and the grading interface. 

To remove a grading category from the assignment settings and the grading interface, see [Remove gradingCategory](/graph/api/educationassignment-delete-gradingcategory).

> **Note:** Assignments in the deleted grading category retain their grades, but teachers can't assign the deleted grading category to other assignments.
