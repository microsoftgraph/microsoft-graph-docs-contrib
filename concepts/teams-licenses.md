# Licenses for subscribing to chat messages

Creating chat message subscriptions with application permissions for `/teams/allMessages` and `/chats/allMessages` will soon require one of the following licenses:

* Office 365 E5
* Office 365 A5
* Microsoft 365 E5
* Microsoft 365 A5
* Microsoft 365 Information Protection and Governance
* Office 365 Advanced Compliance 

Because `/teams/allMessages` and `/chats/allMessages` deliver notifications for all users in the tenant, all users in the tenant must be licensed. 

These licenses are not required when creating subscriptions with delegated permissions, with resource-specific consent permissions, or with application permissions for specific channels and chat threads.
