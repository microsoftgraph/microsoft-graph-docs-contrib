# Configure Microsoft Entra Private Access using Microsoft Graph APIs

[Microsoft Entra Private Access](/entra/global-secure-access/concept-private-access) enables secure remote access to on-premises apps without requiring a VPN.

This tutorial explains how to configure Microsoft Entra Private Access using Microsoft Graph network access APIs. You will:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Create a custom app to configure backend app settings.
> * Set up Microsoft Entra application proxy for private access.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Some API operations in this tutorial use the `beta` endpoint.

## Prerequisites

To follow this tutorial:

- Have a Microsoft Entra tenant with the Microsoft Entra Suite license.
- Install and set up the Private Network Access connector. For more information, see [Add an on-premises application for remote access through application proxy in Microsoft Entra ID](/entra/identity/app-proxy/application-proxy-add-on-premises-application).
- Sign in to an API client like [Graph Explorer](https://aka.ms/ge) with an account that has the required administrator roles. The following [Microsoft Entra roles](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference?toc=%2Fgraph%2Ftoc.json) are the minimum needed for this tutorial:
  - Application Administrator to create the app.
  - Global Secure Access Administrator to configure Global Secure Access settings on the app.
- Grant the app *Directory.ReadWrite.All* and *NetworkAccess.ReadWrite.All* delegated permissions.
- Have a test user to assign to the app.

## Step 1: Create a custom application

To set up the application proxy, first create a custom application, then update the app proxy settings in the **onPremisesPublishing** property. 

Use an application template to create a custom application and service principal in your tenant. The template ID for a custom application is `8adf8e6e-67b2-4cf2-a259-e3dc5476c621`. You can find it by running this query: [GET https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/applicationTemplates?$filter=displayName eq 'Custom'](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/graph-explorer?request=applicationTemplates%3F%24filter%3DdisplayName%2Beq%2B'Custom'&method=GET&version=v1.0&GraphUrl=https://graph.microsoft.com).

From the response, note the **id** of the service principal and application objects, and the **appId** for later use.

The following request creates a custom application named `newPrivateApp`.

        }
    }
}
```

## Step 2: Specify the type of private application

You can create a Global Secure Access private app as either a Quick Access or enterprise app. Set the **application** > **onPremisesPublishing** > **applicationType** property to `quickaccessapp` for Quick Access apps or `nonwebapp` for enterprise apps.

In this step, you set up a Global Secure Access private app as an enterprise app.

The request returns a `204 No Content` response.

## Step 4: Add application segments to the private application

In the example, create a new app segment with the following settings:
- Replace the value of **destinationHost** with the private app destination. 
- Replace the value of **destinationType** with either `ipAddress`, `ipRange`, `ipRangeCidr`, `fqdn`, or `dnsSuffix`.
- Replace the value of **protocol** with either `tcp`, `udp`, or `tcp,udp` depending on the protocol your app uses.
