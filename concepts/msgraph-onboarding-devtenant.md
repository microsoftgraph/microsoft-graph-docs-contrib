# Set up a demo tenant to develop education solutions

You can set up a demo EDU tenant that simulates a Microsoft 365 EDU customer tenant that you can use to develop and test your education solutions.

With this tenant, you can:

- Build rich solutions that integrate Microsoft 365 apps and business processes to enhance productivity in the modern workplace.
- Get a Teams development environment in seconds.
- Extend and customize Teams to create and connect apps and workflows.

To get an EDU developer tenant: 

1. Go to [Partner Sign Up](https://aka.ms/edupartnersignup) and choose **Microsoft Education Integration**.

1. Complete the form. Pay attention to the **Product Information** section. In the **MPN No** field, provide your Microsoft Partner Network ID, and in the **Are you requesting an EDU development tenant?** box, choose **Yes**.

    **Note:** If you don't have a Microsoft Partner Network ID, join the [Microsoft Partner Network](/graph/msgraph-onboarding-mpn).

1. After you provide all the required information, choose **Submit**.

You will receive an email notification about you tenant request.
