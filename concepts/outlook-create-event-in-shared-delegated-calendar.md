# Create Outlook events in a shared or delegated calendar

In Outlook, customers can share a calendar with other users and let them view, create, or modify events in that calendar. Customers can also grant a delegate to act on their behalf to receive or respond to meeting requests or create or change items in the calendar.

Programmatically, Microsoft Graph supports reading or writing events in calendars that have been shared by other users, as well as reading the shared calendars, and updating the calendar name for sharees. The support also applies to calendars that have been delegated. The rest of this article walks through creating a meeting event in a shared or delegated calendar. For getting events, refer to [Get Outlook events in a shared or delegated calendar](outlook-get-shared-events-calendars.md).

The walkthrough below uses the example scenario where Alex has delegated his primary calendar to Adele in Outlook, and kept the default Outlook mailbox setting to direct meeting requests and responses to only delegates. (This setting corresponds to the **delegateMeetingMessageDeliveryOptions** property of Alex' [mailboxSettings](/graph/api/resources/mailboxsettings) set as the default value `sendToDelegateOnly`.) 

The walkthrough describes a few subsequent steps:
1. [Adele gets the calendar that Alex has delegated to her](#step-1-adele-gets-the-delegated-calendar).
2. [Adele sends a meeting invitation to Christie and Megan on Alex' behalf](#step-2-adele-creates-and-sends-an-invitation-on-alex-behalf). 
3. [Christie receives the meeting request, and inspects the associated event in her calendar](#step-3-christie-receives-meeting-request-and-inspects-the-associated-event-in-her-calendar).
4. [Christie responds tentative to the invitation](#step-4-christie-responds-to-the-meeting-request).
5. [Adele receives Christie's response message](#step-5-adele-receives-the-response-message).
6. [Alex checks attendees' responses as part of the event](#step-6-alex-accesses-responses-as-part-of-the-event).

If Alex has shared and not delegated his calendar with Adele:

- Signed in as Adele, an app can [get the calendar that Alex has shared with Adele](outlook-get-shared-events-calendars.md#sharee-get-shared-custom-calendar-or-its-events-from-sharees-mailbox).
- The app can use the requests and responses in steps 2 to 4 to apply to the shared calendar the same way as the delegated calendar.
- In step 5, the app can sign in as Alex, instead of Adele, to receive Christie's response message.

## Step 1: Adele gets the delegated calendar

Signed in as Adele, get the calendars she has access to and identify the one Alex has delegated to her, so to use it in the next step to create an event in that calendar. 

**Microsoft Graph permissions**

Use the least privileged delegated permission, `Calendars.Read.Shared`. For more information, see [calendar permissions](permissions-reference.md#calendars-permissions).

Notice a successful response includes the response code HTTP 200, Adele's own primary calendar, and a copy of the calendar delegated by Alex in Adele's mailbox, with the following properties:

- **canShare** is false since Adele is only a delegate and not the calendar owner.
- **canEdit** is true since as delegate, Adele has write access to non-private events in the delegated calendar.
- **owner** is `Alex Wilber` indicating it is Alex' calendar.

> [!NOTE]
> Signed in as Adele, you can alternatively get the delegated calendar directly from Alex' mailbox, by specifying Alex' identity and the `calendar` shortcut, as in `GET https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/users/AlexW@contoso.OnMicrosoft.com/calendar`. The returned calendar ID corresponds to only Alex' mailbox. 

## Step 2: Adele creates and sends an invitation on Alex' behalf

Signed in as Adele, use the calendar ID obtained from step 1 to create an [event](/graph/api/resources/event) in the delegated calendar and send it to Christie and Megan, on Alex' behalf.

## Step 4: Christie responds to the meeting request

Signed in as Christie, reply to the **event** as tentative, and include a reply message in the response:

A successful response returns HTTP 202 Accepted.

## Step 5: Adele receives the response message

Because Adele is a delegate of Alex' primary calendar, Adele receives all meeting responses for that calendar on Alex' behalf.

Signed in as Adele, get the [eventMessage](/graph/api/resources/eventmessage) that represents the response from Christie in step 4.

Notice a successful response includes the response code HTTP 200 and the following [eventMessage](/graph/api/resources/eventmessage) properties:

- **meetingMessageType** is `meetingTenativelyAccepted`.
- **from** is Christie.
- **toRecipients** includes only Adele, but not the calendar owner Alex. This is because Alex kept the default to have Outlook direct all meeting responses to only delegates.

## Step 6: Alex accesses responses as part of the event

Because Alex kept the default to have Outlook direct all meeting requests and responses to only delegates, Alex does not receive Christie's response from step 4. He can however get the response through the [event](/graph/api/resources/event) in his primary calendar.

Signed in as Alex, get the [event](/graph/api/resources/event) that Adele created in step 2 and get responses from the **attendees** property.

**Microsoft Graph permissions**

Use the least privileged delegated permission, `Calendars.Read`. For more information, see [calendar permissions](permissions-reference.md#calendars-permissions).
